But we need to know if Terengganu's 13th sultan reigned between 2006 and 2011. Let's recall: Terengganu's 13th Sultan is Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin? Wait, let's recall: Terengganu's sultans: 1st Sultan: Sultan Zainal Abidin I (?), 2nd: Sultan Mahmud I, etc. Actually, the 13th Sultan of Terengganu is Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin, who reigned from 1998 to 2018? Wait, let's check: Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin of Terengganu was the 13th Sultan of Terengganu, reigned from 1998 to 2018. He was also elected as the 13th Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia in 2006-2011. So the claim: \"Terengganu's 13th sultan reigned between 2006 and 2011.\" That is partially correct: He reigned from 1998 to 2018, so yes, he reigned during 2006-2011. But the claim says \"reigned between 2006 and 2011\" which could be interpreted as his reign was only between those years, but actually his reign spanned a longer period. The claim might be ambiguous: It could mean his reign included that period. Usually \"reigned between 2006 and 2011\" could mean his reign was during that period, not necessarily exclusively. But we need to interpret. The evidence: \"The current Sultan was elected as the 13th Yang di-Pertuan Agong or King of Malaysia.\" That indicates that the current Sultan (which is Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin) was elected as the 13th Yang di-Pertuan Agong. That implies he was the 13th Sultan of Terengganu? Wait, the evidence says \"The current Sultan was elected as the 13th Yang di-Pertuan Agong or King of Malaysia.\" That indicates the current Sultan (maybe of Terengganu) was elected as the 13th Yang di-Pertuan Agong. That is consistent with Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin. So the claim: \"Terengganu's 13th sultan reigned between 2006 and 2011.\" We know that Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin reigned from 1998 to 2018. So he indeed reigned during 2006-2011. So the claim is partially true. But the claim might be interpreted as \"reigned between 2006 and 2011\" meaning his reign was only during that period. That would be false. But the claim is ambiguous. Usually such claims are interpreted as \"his reign spanned that period\" or \"he reigned during that period.\" The evidence supports that he was the 13th Sultan and he was the 13th Yang di-Pertuan Agong from 2006 to 2011. So the claim is supported. So we choose PASS. Confidence high. Let's output PASS with high confidence.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>LABEL=PASS\nCONF=0.95\nRATIONALE="

But we don't know the year. The claim says 2008. We need to check if November 22 episode of SNL was in 2008. Let's recall: SNL episodes: November 22, 2008? Actually SNL season 34 (2008-2009) had an episode on November 22, 2008? Let's check memory: SNL season 34 started in 2008. The episode on November 22, 2008 might have been the 2008-2009 season. But I'm not certain. Let's think: SNL episodes: Season 34 (2008-2009) had episodes from September 2008 to May 2009. November 22, 2008 would be within that season.

If the episode was on November 22 of a different year, then evidence does not support claim. We don't have explicit year. So we might not have enough evidence to confirm the year. But we might infer that the episode was in 2008 because SNL episodes are usually on Sundays, and November 22, 2008 was a Sunday. But we can't be certain.\n\nWe need to decide if evidence is sufficient to support claim. The evidence says Bill Hader portrayed Morrison on November 22 episode of SNL. The claim says Bill Hader portrayed Morrison in 2008. If the episode was indeed on November 22, 2008, then evidence supports claim. But we don't have explicit year. So we might consider insufficient evidence. But we might also consider that the evidence implies the episode was in 2008 because the date is given as November 22, but no year. But the claim is about 2008. The evidence does not mention year. So we cannot confirm year. So we might classify as NA (not enough info). But we might also consider that the evidence is likely referencing the 2008 episode.

The claim: \"Keith Morrison was portrayed by Bill Hader in 2008.\" The evidence does not mention year. So we cannot confirm that the portrayal happened in 2008. So we cannot support the claim. We also cannot refute it because we don't know if it happened in 2008 or not. So we should choose NA.\n\nConfidence: maybe 0.6? Because we are uncertain. But we can assign 0.6.

That article likely mentions death counts and maybe restrictions. We need to check if 793 deaths on March 21, 2020. I recall Italy had 793 deaths on March 21? Let's recall: On March 21, 2020, Italy had 793 new deaths? I think the daily death count was 793 on March 21. That is correct. And the government had already closed non-essential businesses earlier (March 9). But the claim says \"which resulted in the Italian government closing all non-essential businesses and restricting people's movements.\" That might be inaccurate because those restrictions were earlier, not a result of that day's deaths. But the claim might be that the 793 deaths led to the closure. But the evidence might not support that. The evidence \"Grim milestone: Italy's coronavirus deaths surpass China's\" might mention that Italy had 793 deaths on March 21 and that the government had closed non-essential businesses and restricted movements. But the claim says \"which resulted in the Italian government closing all non-essential businesses and restricting people's movements.\" That might be a causal claim. The evidence might not support that the 793 deaths caused the closures. But the claim might be partially true: Italy recorded 793 deaths on March 21, and the government had closed non-essential businesses and restricted movements. But the claim says \"which resulted in\" implying causation. The evidence might not support that. So we need to decide if the claim is supported, refuted, or insufficient.\n\nWe have only one evidence snippet: \"Grim milestone : Italy 's coronavirus deaths surpass China's\". That likely contains the death count and maybe mention restrictions. But does it mention that the 793 deaths resulted in closures? It might mention that the government had already closed non-essential businesses and restricted movements. But the claim says \"which resulted in the Italian government closing all non-essential businesses and restricting people's movements.\" That might be inaccurate because the closures happened earlier. So the claim might be partially true but the causal link is wrong. So we might consider the claim as partially false. But the question: \"Classify whether a claim is supported, refuted, or has insufficient evidence.\" The claim is a single statement. We need to decide if the evidence supports or refutes it. The evidence might not mention the causal link. So we might consider the claim as not fully supported. But is it refuted? The claim says that the 793 deaths resulted in closures. That is not supported by evidence. So we might consider it as refuted. But the evidence might not mention the causal link. So we might consider insufficient evidence. But the claim is a single statement. The evidence might not mention the causal link. So we might consider the claim as not supported. But is it refuted? The evidence might not mention that the closures were a result of that day's deaths. So we might consider the claim as not supported. But we need to decide between PASS, FAIL, NA.\n\nGiven the evidence, we cannot confirm the causal link. So we might consider the claim as not supported. But is it refuted? The evidence might not mention that the closures were a result of that day's deaths. So we might consider it as insufficient evidence.

The claim also says \"several subjects were asymptomatic\". The evidence does not mention asymptomatic. So we cannot confirm that asymptomatic subjects were found. So maybe insufficient evidence. But the claim also says \"leading them to believe that the actual number of cases would be much higher.\" The evidence says \"positive tests may indicate infections may be higher than reported.\" That supports the belief. But the asymptomatic part is not supported. So overall, the evidence partially supports but not fully. The instruction: \"Return NA ONLY if the provided evidence is genuinely insufficient to support or refute the claim. If the evidence explicitly supports the claim, choose PASS. If it explicitly contradicts the claim, choose FAIL.\" The evidence does not explicitly support the claim that asymptomatic subjects were found. So maybe insufficient evidence. But the evidence does support the belief that actual number of cases higher. But the claim includes both aspects. The evidence partially supports but not fully. So we might choose NA. But we need to decide.\n\nLet's analyze: Claim: \"Screening for COVID-19 in New York City showed that several subjects were asymptomatic, leading them to believe that the actual number of cases would be much higher.\" The evidence: \"Screening for COVID-19 in pregnant women in New York City, and blood donors in the Netherlands, has also found a number of positive tests that may indicate infections may be higher than reported.\" This evidence indicates that screening found positive tests, but not necessarily asymptomatic. It also indicates that infections may be higher. So the evidence partially supports the claim but not the asymptomatic part. The claim is about asymptomatic subjects. The evidence does not mention asymptomatic. So we cannot confirm that asymptomatic subjects were found. So the evidence does not fully support the claim. So we should choose NA.\n\nConfidence: maybe 0.55? But we need to output a confidence between 0 and 1. We can set 0.55.

No. We need evidence that no other player had 4. The evidence does not say that. So we cannot confirm the claim. We cannot refute it either. So NA. Confidence maybe 0.5.

That means total number of videos with >10M likes is less than 11? Wait: \"Besides See You Again, there are less than 10 videos that have surpassed 10 million likes.\" So excluding See You Again, there are <10 videos with >10M likes. That means total videos with >10M likes is <=10? Actually if there are less than 10 videos besides See You Again, then total videos with >10M likes is less than 11. But evidence says: \"The video is the second to reach 10 million likes ; the other nine videos to exceed 10 million likes are ...\".

Wait: The evidence says \"The video is the second to reach 10 million likes ; the other nine videos to exceed 10 million likes are ...\". That means there are nine other videos besides the subject video that have >10M likes. So total videos with >10M likes is 10 (the subject video + nine others). But the claim says besides See You Again, there are less than 10 videos that have surpassed 10 million likes. That would mean there are at most 9 videos besides See You Again. But evidence says there are nine other videos besides the subject video? Wait: The subject video might be \"See You Again\"? Actually the claim refers to \"Besides See You Again, there are less than 10 videos that have surpassed 10 million likes.\" So the subject video is \"See You Again\". The evidence says \"The video is the second to reach 10 million likes ; the other nine videos to exceed 10 million likes are ...\". That suggests that the video being described is the second to reach 10M likes, which is \"See You Again\" (makes sense). The other nine videos are the ones listed. So there are nine other videos besides See You Again that have >10M likes. That means there are exactly nine other videos. The claim says \"less than 10 videos\" besides See You Again. Nine is less than 10. So the claim is supported. Wait: The claim says \"there are less than 10 videos that have surpassed 10 million likes.\" That means the number of videos besides See You Again that have >10M likes is less than 10. Nine is less than 10. So the claim is true. The evidence says there are nine other videos. So the claim is supported. So label PASS.\n\nConfidence: high. 0.98.

Claim says before Oct 5 2019, it reported 4.2B views. The evidence says as of Oct 5 2019, over 4.2B. That means at that date it had >4.2B. The claim says before Oct 5 2019, it reported 4.2B.

The claim says less than 189,900. The evidence says more than 189,000. That is consistent with claim if the actual number is between 189,001 and 189,899. But we don't know. So evidence insufficient to support or refute. So NA. Confidence maybe 0.5? But we need to output a confidence between 0 and 1. Since insufficient evidence, we choose NA. Confidence maybe 0.5?

Claim: before Dec 9 2018, it reported 22.3 million likes. The evidence says \"over 22.3 million likes as of Dec 9 2018.\" That means at that date it had more than 22.3 million likes. The claim says before Dec 9 2018 it reported 22.3 million likes. The evidence says as of Dec 9 2018 it had over 22.3 million likes. That supports that before Dec 9 2018 it had at least 22.3 million likes? Actually \"over 22.3 million likes\" means >22.3 million. So before Dec 9 2018, it had >22.3 million likes. The claim says it reported 22.3 million likes. That is slightly different: \"reported 22.3 million likes\" could mean exactly 22.3 million likes. But evidence says over 22.3 million.

But the evidence does not explicitly refute the claim. It says \"over 22.3 million likes\" which includes 22.3 million.

The claim: before July 24, 2019, it reported 4.1 billion views. The evidence says as of July 24, 2019, it has over 4.1 billion views. That means at that date it had over 4.1 billion. The claim says before July 24, 2019, it reported 4.1 billion views. The evidence indicates that on July 24, 2019, it had over 4.1 billion. So before that date, it might have had less than 4.1 billion. The claim says it reported 4.1 billion before July 24, 2019. The evidence says as of July 24, 2019, it has over 4.1 billion. That does not necessarily support that before July 24, 2019, it had 4.1 billion. It could have reached 4.1 billion exactly on July 24, 2019. The evidence says \"over 4.1 billion\" as of July 24, 2019. That implies that by that date, it had at least 4.1 billion. The claim says before July 24, 2019, it reported 4.1 billion. That is ambiguous: \"reported 4.1 billion views\" could mean the reported number was 4.1 billion. The evidence says it had over 4.1 billion as of July 24, 2019. That could support that before July 24, 2019, it had 4.1 billion? Actually, if it had over 4.1 billion as of July 24, 2019, then before that date, it might have had less than 4.1 billion. But the claim says it reported 4.1 billion before July 24, 2019. That would be false if it had less than 4.1 billion before that date. But we don't know the exact number before July 24. The evidence says \"over 4.1 billion\" as of July 24. That means at that date, it had at least 4.1 billion. It could have reached 4.1 billion earlier. But the evidence doesn't confirm that it had exactly 4.1 billion before July 24. It only says as of July 24, it had over 4.1 billion. So the claim is not supported by evidence. It might be refuted? The evidence says as of July 24, 2019, it has over 4.1 billion. The claim says before July 24, 2019, it reported 4.1 billion. That could be false if it had less than 4.1 billion before July 24. But we don't have evidence that it had less. The evidence says \"over 4.1 billion\" as of July 24. That implies that at that date, it had at least 4.1 billion. It could have reached 4.1 billion earlier. But the evidence doesn't confirm that. So we cannot confirm the claim. We also cannot refute it because we don't know the exact number before July 24.

But the claim might be considered supported because the evidence says 60-70% will need to become infected. The claim says \"infected or vaccinated.\" That includes infected.

But claim says he scored his first league goal in 3-1 victory against Wigan, and he assisted Nigel Reo-Coker on the first goal. We need to check if that match was 3-1 victory for Bolton vs Wigan. Let's recall: On 15 Oct 2011? Actually Chris Eagles played for Bolton 2011-2013. On 15 Oct 2011, Bolton vs Wigan? I think Bolton 3-1 Wigan? Let's check memory: Bolton vs Wigan 3-1 on 15 Oct 2011? I think yes, Bolton 3-1 Wigan at the Reebok Stadium. Did Chris Eagles score? He scored? I think he scored the second goal? Wait: I recall that Bolton's first goal was by Nigel Reo-Coker?

Actually I think the first goal was by Nigel Reo-Coker? I'm not sure.\n\nBut the claim says Chris Eagles scored his first league goal for Bolton in that match, and he assisted Nigel Reo-Coker on the first goal. That would mean Eagles scored, and he assisted Reo-Coker on the first goal. But if Reo-Coker scored first, then Eagles assisted him. That would mean Eagles had an assist. But the claim says he scored his first league goal. So he scored a goal in that match. Did he score? I think he scored the second goal? Actually I think he scored the second goal? Wait: Let's recall: Bolton 3-1 Wigan 15 Oct 2011. I think the goals: 1-0 Reo-Coker, 1-1? Actually maybe the second goal was by Chris Eagles? I think yes, Chris Eagles scored the second goal. Then the third goal was by? Maybe by? Actually I think the third goal was by? Maybe by? Actually I think the third goal was by? I think the third goal was by? I'm not sure.\n\nBut the claim says he assisted Nigel Reo-Coker on the first goal. That would mean he had an assist on Reo-Coker's goal. But if Reo-Coker scored first, then Eagles assisted him. That would mean Eagles had an assist. But the claim says he scored his first league goal. So he scored later. That could be plausible: He assisted Reo-Coker's first goal, then scored his own goal later. So the claim might be true.\n\nBut we need evidence. The evidence provided only says his first league goal came on Oct 15 vs Wigan. It doesn't mention assist or the scoreline. So we don't have evidence about assist or the scoreline. We need to determine if claim is supported, refuted, or insufficient.\n\nWe have evidence that his first league goal came on Oct 15 vs Wigan. That matches the claim that his first league goal was in a 3-1 victory against Wigan. But we don't have evidence about the scoreline or assist. The claim also says he assisted Nigel Reo-Coker on the first goal. We don't have evidence for that. So we cannot confirm or refute that part.

We also don't have evidence that contradicts it. So we have insufficient evidence to confirm the entire claim. So classification: NA.\n\nConfidence: maybe 0.55?

But we need to know if there were two seasons total, 20 episodes total, and series ended after July 2015.\n\nWe need to check if Wayward Pines had two seasons. I recall Wayward Pines had two seasons: Season 1 (10 episodes) and Season 2 (10 episodes). Total 20 episodes. The series ended after July 2015? Wait, Season 2 aired later. Season 2 premiered in 2016? Actually Wayward Pines Season 2 premiered on January 12, 2016, and concluded in March 2016. So the entire series ended after July 2015? That would be false because the series ended after July 2015 (i.e., after July 2015). The entire series ended after July 2015? The entire series ended after July 2015 means the series ended after July 2015, i.e., after July 2015. That is true because the series ended in March 2016, which is after July 2015. So the claim that the entire series ended after July 2015 is true. But we need to check if the entire series ended after July 2015. The series ended in March 2016, which is after July 2015. So that part is correct.\n\nBut we need to check if the series had two seasons with a total of 20 episodes. That is also correct: Season 1 had 10 episodes, Season 2 had 10 episodes, total 20 episodes. So the claim is correct.\n\nBut we need to check if the evidence provided supports this claim. The evidence only says: series premiered on Fox on May 14, 2015, and first season concluded on July 23, 2015. That evidence does not mention number of seasons or episodes or the end date of the series. So the evidence is insufficient to support the claim. We need to see if we can infer from evidence that the series ended after July 2015. The evidence says first season concluded July 23, 2015. That doesn't say the entire series ended after July 2015. It only says first season ended July 23, 2015. The claim says entire series ended after July 2015. That is not contradicted by evidence. But we cannot confirm it. So we have insufficient evidence to support or refute the claim. So we should output NA.\n\nBut we need to consider if the evidence contradicts the claim. The evidence does not contradict the claim.

Claim: before 9 July 2018, it reported 3.6 billion views. The evidence says as of July 9 2018, it has over 3.6 billion views. That means by July 9 2018, it had over 3.6 billion views. Claim says before July 9 2018, it reported 3.6 billion views. The evidence indicates that on July 9 2018, it had over 3.6 billion views. That supports the claim that before July 9 2018, it had 3.6 billion views? Actually \"before 9 July 2018\" means earlier than July 9. The evidence says as of July 9, it had over 3.6 billion views.

The evidence says \"over 3.6 billion views\" as of July 9. That might support that before July 9, it had at least 3.6 billion views. But the claim says \"reported 3.6 billion views\" which is a specific number. The evidence says \"over 3.6 billion views\" which is not exactly 3.6. So the evidence does not explicitly support that it reported exactly 3.6 billion views before July 9. It only says it had over 3.6 billion views as of July 9. That might be considered as supporting the claim that it had 3.6 billion views before July 9? The claim says \"Before 9 July 2018 , See You Again reported 3.6 billion views.\" That could be interpreted as \"Before July 9 2018, the video had 3.6 billion views.\" The evidence says \"As of July 9 2018, it has received over 3.6 billion views.\" That indicates that by July 9, it had more than 3.6 billion.
