Let's compute quickly: 1977 is not a leap year. 1977-01-01 day? Let's use known: 1970-01-01 was Thursday. 1977 is 7 years later. 1970-01-01 Thursday. 1971: 1970 not leap? 1970 not leap. 1971: 1970 had 365 days, so 1971-01-01 is Friday. 1972: 1971 not leap, so 1972-01-01 is Saturday. 1973: 1972 is leap, so 1973-01-01 is Monday? Wait: 1972 had 366 days, so 1973-01-01 is Monday? Let's compute: 1972-01-01 was Saturday. Add 366 days => 366 mod 7 = 2 days shift. Saturday + 2 = Monday. Yes. 1974: 1973 not leap, so 1974-01-01 is Tuesday. 1975: 1974 not leap, so 1975-01-01 is Wednesday. 1976: 1975 not leap, so 1976-01-01 is Thursday. 1977: 1976 is leap, so 1977-01-01 is Saturday? Wait: 1976-01-01 was Thursday. Add 366 days => shift 2 days: Thursday + 2 = Saturday. So 1977-01-01 is Saturday. Now we need day of week for 1977-10-11. Let's compute days from Jan 1 to Oct 11. Months days: Jan 31, Feb 28 (1977 not leap), Mar 31, Apr 30, May 31, Jun 30, Jul 31, Aug 31, Sep 30, Oct 11 days. Sum: Jan 31, Feb 28 => 59, Mar 31 => 90, Apr 30 => 120, May 31 => 151, Jun 30 => 181, Jul 31 => 212, Aug 31 => 243, Sep 30 => 273, Oct 11 => 284. So day number 284 from Jan 1 inclusive? Actually Jan 1 is day 1. So Oct 11 is day 284. So days since Jan 1: 283 days after Jan 1. 283 mod 7 = 283 - 7*40 = 283 - 280 = 3. So shift 3 days from Saturday. Saturday + 3 = Tuesday. So indeed Oct 11, 1977 was a Tuesday. So claim is correct. So PASS. Confidence high. 0.99. Rationale empty.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>LABEL=PASS\nCONF=0.99\nRATIONALE="

That means Cape Town was not included? Wait: \"included many towns except Cape Town\" could mean that filming locations included many towns, but not Cape Town. So Cape Town is excluded. The evidence says filming locations include Delhi, Mumbai, Patna, Dumraon, Varanasi, New York City and Cape Town. So Cape Town is included. That contradicts the claim. So the claim is false.

But the instruction might want us to say NA because no evidence. But the claim is obviously false. But the instruction says we can use knowledge. But we might still say FAIL. But we need to decide.\n\nLet's read the instructions carefully:\n\n\"You are a fact verification expert. Classify whether a claim is supported, refuted, or has insufficient evidence.\"\n\nWe have no evidence. But we can still use knowledge. But the instruction says \"You have additional evidence to consider in case you need it: No relevant evidence available.\" So we cannot rely on evidence. But we can still use knowledge. But the instruction says \"Return NA ONLY if the provided evidence is genuinely insufficient to support or refute the claim.\" We have no evidence. But we can still refute based on knowledge. But the instruction might want us to say NA because no evidence. But the claim is obviously false. But we can still say FAIL. But we need to decide.\n\nLet's consider the typical approach: If we have no evidence, we might still be able to refute or support based on knowledge.

I'm stuck.\n\nOk, this is going nowhere. Let's step back.\n\nWe need to decide classification. We have no evidence. The claim: \"Jos\u00e9 Ferrer played the part of Cyrano de Bergerac in 1947.\" We need to determine if this is supported, refuted, or insufficient evidence.\n\nWe have no evidence. So we cannot confirm or refute. So we should classify as NA (not enough info). But we need to consider if we know from general knowledge that Jos\u00e9 Ferrer played Cyrano in 1950 film, not 1947. So the claim is likely false. But we don't have evidence. But we can use general knowledge: The 1947 film \"Cyrano de Bergerac\" starred Jos\u00e9 Ferrer? Actually, I think the 1947 film starred Jos\u00e9 Ferrer? Wait, I recall that the 1947 film \"Cyrano de Bergerac\" starred Jos\u00e9 Ferrer?

But we can use general knowledge: Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded in 1912? Actually yes, Nobel Prizes are awarded annually. So 1912 had a Nobel Prize in Chemistry. So claim \"The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded in 1912.\" That is true. But we need to check if the claim is \"The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded in 1912.\" That is ambiguous: It could mean \"The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded in 1912\" meaning the prize was awarded that year. That is true. So we can classify as PASS. But we have no evidence. But we can rely on general knowledge.

But the instruction says \"If the evidence explicitly supports the claim, choose PASS. If it explicitly contradicts the claim, choose FAIL.\" We don't have evidence. So we cannot choose PASS or FAIL. But we can use knowledge. But the instruction says \"Return NA ONLY if the provided evidence is genuinely insufficient to support or refute the claim.\" The evidence is insufficient. So we should return NA. But we can also consider that we know the claim is false. But the instruction says we must rely on evidence. Since we have no evidence, we cannot confirm or refute. So we should return NA. But we can also consider that we know the claim is false. But the instruction says \"Return NA ONLY if the provided evidence is genuinely insufficient to support or refute the claim.\" We have no evidence. So we should return NA.

No. Maybe \"born on a boat\" refers to actor \"Chris Rock\"? He was born in Brooklyn. Not boat. \"Born on a boat\" might refer to actor \"Will Smith\" being born on a boat? No. So claim likely false.

She was born in New York City, but I think they grew up in California. But the claim says \"are Americans from California.\" That could be ambiguous: \"from California\" could mean they are from California (i.e., born or raised there).

Rock Band 3 had a track list of many songs. I recall Numb was included as a downloadable track? Wait, Numb by Linkin Park was included in Rock Band 3 as a downloadable track? Actually I think Numb was included in Rock Band 3 as a downloadable track, but maybe not in the base game. But the claim says \"was in a 2010 music video game developed by Harmonix.\" That could refer to Rock Band 3 (2010). Did Numb appear? I think yes, Numb was included as a downloadable track for Rock Band 3. But the claim might be ambiguous: \"was in a 2010 music video game developed by Harmonix.\" That could be true. But we need evidence. We have no evidence provided. But we can recall knowledge: Rock Band 3 was released in 2010, developed by Harmonix. Numb was indeed a track in Rock Band 3.
