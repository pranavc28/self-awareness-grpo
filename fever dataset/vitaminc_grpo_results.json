That matches claim: CDC encouraged elders and people with severe chronic conditions to avoid crowds and self-isolate at their residencies. The evidence says advised to avoid crowds and stay home as much as possible. That is essentially same. So evidence supports claim. So PASS.\n\nConfidence: evidence explicitly states advice to avoid crowds and stay home. Claim says CDC encouraged elders and people with severe chronic conditions to avoid crowds and self-isolate at their residencies. That is consistent. So high confidence. 0.95? But guidelines: 0.90-0.99: evidence explicit and unambiguous. Yes. So 0.95. Rationale empty.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>LABEL=PASS\nCONF=0.95\nRATIONALE="

Lunar New Year holiday? Lunar New Year 2020 in Hong Kong: 25 Jan? Actually Lunar New Year 2020 was Jan 25. The holiday maybe 25-27 Jan? The evidence says closing for two more weeks on top of previously scheduled New Year holiday, pushing reopening to 17 Feb. That means reopening 17 Feb, which is about 2 weeks after Lunar New Year holiday? Let's compute: Lunar New Year holiday maybe 25-27 Jan. 17 Feb is about 3 weeks after. But the claim says \"will reopen 2 weeks after the Lunar New Year Holiday\". Evidence says \"closing for two more weeks on top of the previously scheduled New Year holiday, pushing the date for school reopening to 17 February.\" That implies reopening 17 Feb. The claim says 2 weeks after Lunar New Year Holiday. The evidence says 2 weeks after? It says \"close for two more weeks on top of the previously scheduled New Year holiday\". That means the closure extends two weeks beyond the holiday. So the reopening date is 17 Feb. The claim says \"will reopen 2 weeks after the Lunar New Year Holiday\". That matches: the reopening date is 17 Feb, which is about 2 weeks after the holiday? Let's check: Lunar New Year holiday maybe 25-27 Jan. 17 Feb is about 3 weeks after 25 Jan. But the evidence says \"two more weeks on top of the previously scheduled New Year holiday\". That implies the closure extends two weeks beyond the holiday. So the reopening date is 17 Feb. The claim says \"will reopen 2 weeks after the Lunar New Year Holiday\". That is consistent with evidence: the reopening date is 17 Feb, which is 2 weeks after the holiday? Actually 17 Feb is 3 weeks after 25 Jan. But maybe the holiday was 25 Jan to 27 Jan? 17 Feb is 21 days after 27 Jan, which is 3 weeks. But the evidence says \"two more weeks on top of the previously scheduled New Year holiday\". That means the closure is two weeks after the holiday. So the reopening date is 17 Feb. So the claim says \"will reopen 2 weeks after the Lunar New Year Holiday\". That matches the evidence: the reopening date is 17 Feb, which is 2 weeks after the holiday? Wait, the evidence says \"closing for two more weeks on top of the previously scheduled New Year holiday\". That means the closure extends two weeks beyond the holiday. So the reopening date is 17 Feb. So the claim says \"will reopen 2 weeks after the Lunar New Year Holiday\". That matches: the reopening date is 17 Feb, which is 2 weeks after the holiday? Actually 17 Feb is 3 weeks after 25 Jan. But maybe the holiday ended earlier? The holiday might have ended on 25 Jan? Actually the Lunar New Year holiday might have been 25 Jan to 27 Jan.

Evidence says organoids help study brain growth and therapeutic applications. That could help disease development? It's ambiguous. The evidence does not explicitly state that disease development has been assisted. It says organoids opened ways for studying brain growth and therapeutic applications. That could be interpreted as assisting disease development? But not explicit. So likely NA. Confidence moderate. Let's output NA with confidence 0.65.

Claim: before July 19 2019, the video had 24.5 million likes. Evidence: as of July 19 2019, it has over 24.6 million likes. That means at that date, likes > 24.6 million. So before that date, likes could be less or equal? Actually \"as of July 19 2019\" includes that date. So at that date, likes > 24.6 million. That implies that before that date, likes were less than or equal to that? Wait, if as of July 19 2019 it has over 24.6 million likes, then at that date it had >24.6 million. So before that date, it could have had less than that, but could also have had more? No, likes accumulate over time, so before that date, likes would be less than or equal to that date's count. So before July 19 2019, likes were less than or equal to >24.6 million. But claim says 24.5 million likes before July 19 2019. That is plausible: if as of July 19 2019 it had >24.6 million, then before that date it could have had 24.5 million.

Actually if as of July 19 it had >24.6 million, then before that date it had less than that, but could still be 24.5 million. So evidence does not contradict claim. Does it entail?

Claim says before 14 September 2018, it reported 3.7 billion views. Evidence says as of that date, over 3.7 billion. That means at that date it had >3.7bn.

Evidence says as of Dec 8 2018, it has received over 22.3 million likes. So evidence says at that date it had over 22.3 million likes. Claim says after that date it reported 22.3 million likes. The evidence says \"over 22.3 million likes\" as of that date. That implies that at that date it had at least 22.3 million likes. The claim says after that date it reported 22.3 million likes. The evidence says \"over 22.3 million likes\" as of that date. That is consistent: after that date, it could have reported 22.3 million likes (maybe exactly 22.3 million). But evidence says \"over 22.3 million likes\" as of that date, which implies that at that date it had more than 22.3 million likes. So the claim says after that date it reported 22.3 million likes. That could be consistent: maybe it reported 22.3 million likes after that date, but evidence says as of that date it had over 22.3 million likes. That is contradictory? Let's parse.\n\nClaim: \"After 8 December 2018 , See You Again reported 22.3 million likes .\"\n\nInterpretation: After that date, the video reported 22.3 million likes. That could mean that at some point after that date, the reported likes count was 22.3 million. Evidence: \"It has received over 22.3 million likes and over 735,000 dislikes as of December 8 , 2018 .\"\n\nSo evidence says as of Dec 8 2018, it had over 22.3 million likes. That means at that date, the likes count was >22.3 million. So the claim that after that date it reported 22.3 million likes is inconsistent because at that date it already had more than 22.3 million likes. But the claim says after that date it reported 22.3 million likes. That could be a lower number than the actual count at that date. So the claim is likely false. The evidence contradicts the claim.

So number of critics with rating <47% is less than 15.\n\nEvidence: Metacritic score 48/100 based on 15 critics. That means average weighted score 48. But does that imply that less than 15 critics gave rating <47%? Not necessarily. The average could be 48 even if all 15 critics gave rating 48 or higher. But could also be some below 47. But evidence does not specify distribution. So evidence does not entail claim. Does it contradict? If average 48, could still have some below 47. But claim says less than 15 critics gave rating <47%. That could be true or false. Evidence doesn't contradict because it's possible that less than 15 critics gave rating <47%. But also possible that all 15 gave rating <47% but average 48? Wait if all 15 gave rating <47, average would be <47. So cannot be all 15. So at most 14 critics could have rating <47. But evidence doesn't specify distribution. But we can deduce that at least one critic gave rating >=47? Actually if average 48, it's possible that all 15 gave rating 48 or higher. So at least 0 critics gave rating <47. So claim \"less than 15 critics gave rating <47%\" is true because at most 14 critics could have rating <47. But evidence doesn't guarantee that less than 15 critics gave rating <47%. Wait if average 48, it's impossible that all 15 gave rating <47 because then average would be <47. So at most 14 critics gave rating <47. So claim is necessarily true. Because less than 15 critics gave rating <47% is logically entailed by evidence? Let's analyze: Suppose average 48. Could there be 15 critics with rating <47? No. So at most 14. So claim holds. So evidence entails claim. But is that a logical entailment? Yes, because evidence states average 48 based on 15 critics. That implies that not all 15 critics gave rating <47. So number of critics with rating <47 is less than 15. So claim is entailed. So PASS.\n\nConfidence high. 0.95.
