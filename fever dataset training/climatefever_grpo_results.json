Observed warming ~0.2\u00b0C per decade. Since 1988 to 2020 ~32 years ~3.2 decades, so ~0.64\u00b0C warming. Models predicted 1.1 to 6.4\u00b0C by 2100, which is 1.1-6.4\u00b0C over 110 years. But the claim is about 3 times the amount of warming seen since 1988. Observed warming ~0.64\u00b0C. 3 times that is ~1.92\u00b0C. Models predicted 1.1-6.4\u00b0C by 2100, which includes 1.92\u00b0C. But the claim is about \"predicted about three times the amount of warming in the world we\u2019ve seen since 1988.\" That would be 3x observed warming. Observed warming ~0.64\u00b0C. 3x ~1.92\u00b0C. Models predicted 1.1-6.4\u00b0C by 2100. So yes, models predicted at least 1.92\u00b0C by 2100. But the claim might refer to the difference between predicted warming and observed warming. The evidence: \"Models referenced by the IPCC predict that global temperatures are likely to increase by 1.1 to 6.4\u00b0C between 1990 and 2100.\" Observed warming since 1988 ~0.2\u00b0C per decade. That is ~0.64\u00b0C. So predicted warming is 1.1-6.4\u00b0C, which is about 1.7-10 times the observed warming. So the claim that models predicted about three times the amount of warming seen since 1988 is plausible. But we need to see if evidence explicitly supports or refutes. The evidence says predicted warming 1.1-6.4\u00b0C between 1990 and 2100. Observed warming 0.2\u00b0C per decade. So predicted warming is about 5-30 times observed warming. But the claim says about 3 times. That is within the range. So evidence supports the claim. But we need to see if evidence explicitly states that models predicted about 3 times the warming. It doesn't explicitly say 3 times. But we can infer. The evidence: predicted 1.1-6.4\u00b0C by 2100. Observed warming 0.2\u00b0C per decade. Over 30 years, observed warming ~0.6\u00b0C. So predicted warming 1.1-6.4\u00b0C is about 2-10 times observed. So the claim that models predicted about 3 times the warming is plausible. So we can say PASS. Confidence maybe 0.75.

The claim: \"Had he used the currently accepted value of approximately 3\u00b0C warming for a doubling of atmospheric CO2, Hansen would have correctly projected the ensuing global warming.\" This is a hypothetical.

He also said that if sensitivity below 3\u00b0C, warming would be below that. The evidence does not mention that he would have correctly projected if he used 3\u00b0C. So insufficient evidence.

Which report? Likely the IPCC AR5 report? Actually AR5 was published in 2013. But the claim says September 18, maybe 2019? Let's parse.\n\nThe claim: \"The report, published in the journal Nature Geoscience on September 18, acknowledges that most of the models of warming trends failed to predict the \u2018slowdown\u2019 in warming post-2000, resulting in less pronounced warming than predicted and thus more room in the CO2 \u2018emissions budget\u2019 for the coming decades.\"\n\nWe need to verify if this is supported by evidence. The evidence includes:\n\n- Global warming hiatus: a detailed study supports conclusion that warming is continuing, but less warming between 2001-2010 than climate models predicted, slowdown attributed to PDO.\n\n- Another bullet: A month before formal AR5 publication, a leaked draft of the report noted that \"Models do not generally reproduce the observed reduction in surface warming trend over the last 10\u201315 years\", but lacked clear explanations, attracted media coverage.\n\n- Another bullet: They used IPCC definition of hiatus as slowdown from 1998-2012 vs 1951-2012, found no support for hiatus.\n\n- 2017 US National Climate Assessment notes climate models may still be underestimating or missing relevant feedback processes.\n\n- IPCC judged global mean surface air temperature increased 0.3-0.6\u00b0C over last 100 years, consistent with predictions, same magnitude as natural variability.\n\nWe need to determine if claim is supported, refuted, or insufficient.\n\nThe claim: The report acknowledges that most models failed to predict slowdown, resulting in less warming than predicted and more room in CO2 emissions budget.\n\nEvidence: The leaked draft of the report (AR5) noted that models do not reproduce observed reduction in surface warming trend over last 10-15 years. That supports the claim that models failed to predict slowdown. But does it say \"most models\" or \"most of the models\"? The draft says \"Models do not generally reproduce the observed reduction\". That implies many models. So that supports.\n\nBut does the report say \"resulting in less pronounced warming than predicted and thus more room in the CO2 emissions budget for the coming decades\"? The evidence does not mention emissions budget. The bullet about the study says slowdown might be due to PDO. The bullet about IPCC says no support for hiatus. The bullet about US assessment says models may still be underestimating or missing feedback processes. None mention emissions budget.\n\nThus the claim includes two parts: 1) models failed to predict slowdown; 2) this results in less warming than predicted and more room in emissions budget. The evidence supports part 1 but not part 2. The claim might be partially supported but not fully. The question: \"Classify whether a claim is supported, refuted, or has insufficient evidence.\" We need to decide if the claim is supported overall. If evidence partially supports but not fully, we might consider insufficient evidence. But we need to interpret the instruction: \"If the evidence explicitly supports the claim, choose PASS. If it explicitly contradicts the claim, choose FAIL. Return NA ONLY if the provided evidence is genuinely insufficient to support or refute the claim.\" So we need to see if evidence explicitly supports the claim. The evidence partially supports but not fully. But does it explicitly support the entire claim? The claim includes \"most models failed to predict slowdown\" - evidence supports that. \"Resulting in less pronounced warming than predicted and thus more room in the CO2 emissions budget for the coming decades.\" The evidence does not mention emissions budget. So the claim is not fully supported. But is there evidence that the report acknowledges that models failed to predict slowdown? Yes. But does it mention emissions budget? No. So the claim is partially supported but not fully. The instruction says \"If the evidence explicitly supports the claim, choose PASS.\" But the evidence does not explicitly support the entire claim. So we might choose NA because insufficient evidence to support or refute the entire claim. But we need to decide.\n\nLet's examine the claim: \"The report, published in the journal Nature Geoscience on September 18, acknowledges that most of the models of warming trends failed to predict the \u2018slowdown\u2019 in warming post-2000, resulting in less pronounced warming than predicted and thus more room in the CO2 \u2018emissions budget\u2019 for the coming decades.\"\n\nWe need to check if the report acknowledges that models failed to predict slowdown. The leaked draft of the report (AR5) noted that \"Models do not generally reproduce the observed reduction in surface warming trend over the last 10\u201315 years\". That is evidence that the report acknowledges this. So part of claim is supported.\n\nBut the claim also says \"resulting in less pronounced warming than predicted and thus more room in the CO2 emissions budget for the coming decades.\" The evidence does not mention emissions budget. So we cannot confirm that part. So the claim is partially supported but not fully. The instruction: \"Return NA ONLY if the provided evidence is genuinely insufficient to support or refute the claim.\" The evidence partially supports but not fully. But we can still say the claim is not fully supported. But is it refuted? No. So we might choose NA because we cannot confirm the entire claim. But we might also choose PASS because the evidence supports the claim that models failed to predict slowdown. But the claim includes additional part about emissions budget. The evidence does not support that part. So the claim is not fully supported. So we should choose NA.\n\nBut we need to consider the possibility that the claim is partially supported but not fully. The instruction says \"If the evidence explicitly supports the claim, choose PASS.\" The evidence does not explicitly support the entire claim. So we cannot choose PASS. \"If it explicitly contradicts the claim, choose FAIL.\" Not contradicted. So we choose NA.\n\nThus label NA. Confidence maybe 0.70? Because we are fairly sure that evidence is insufficient to fully support claim. But we might assign 0.70.

That is less than half. But also natural processes can absorb about half of that amount? Wait: \"It is estimated that natural processes can only absorb about half of that amount, so there is a net increase of 10.65 billion tonnes of atmospheric carbon dioxide per year.\" This seems to say natural processes absorb about half of emissions. So net increase equals emissions minus natural absorption. If natural absorption is half, then atmospheric increase is half of emissions.

But natural sinks include oceans plus other sinks like terrestrial biosphere. So total natural absorption could be about half.

The claim is ambiguous: \"It has occurred during the warmest year on record, which occurred in 2015, and the two most unusually mild months on Earth, which took place in January and February, respectively.\" So the claim is that something occurred during 2015 and during January and February. But we need to verify if 2015 was the warmest year on record. According to climate data, 2015 was indeed the warmest year on record globally, as per NOAA and NASA. So that part is correct. The claim also says \"the two most unusually mild months on Earth, which took place in January and February, respectively.\" Are January and February the two most unusually mild months on Earth? That seems questionable. The evidence provided: 2006 European heat wave: December, January, February were extremely mild. But the claim says January and February were the two most unusually mild months on Earth. That is not supported by evidence. The evidence says December, January, February were mild in 2006/2007. But the claim says January and February were the two most unusually mild months on Earth. There's no evidence that January and February were the two most unusually mild months on Earth. The evidence says December, January, February were mild in 2006/2007. But the claim says January and February were the two most unusually mild months on Earth. That is not supported.

The claim is that 2015 was the warmest year on record, and that January and February were the two most unusually mild months on Earth. The evidence: 2015 was indeed the warmest year on record.

The question: \"Classify whether a claim is supported, refuted, or has insufficient evidence.\" The claim is partially false. We need to decide if the claim is supported, refuted, or insufficient evidence. The claim is not fully supported. The evidence does not support the mild months part. So the claim is refuted? The claim is partially false. The evidence contradicts the mild months part. So we should classify as FAIL (refuted). Because the claim is not fully supported.

In 2002, this was more energy in one hour than the world used in one year. That seems contradictory: 392 MW * 1 hour = 392 MWh. World used in one year? That seems wrong. But evidence says \"more energy in one hour than the world used in one year.\" That would be huge. But maybe it's misinterpreted. But we can evaluate claim.\n\nWe need to determine if evidence supports or refutes claim. We have US energy market about 29,000 terawatt hours per year. 29,000 TWh = 29,000,000 GWh. 1 TWh = 1,000,000 MWh. So 29,000 TWh = 29,000,000,000 MWh. 1 MW plant operating at 100% capacity for 1 year: 1 MW * 8760 hours = 8760 MWh. So 1 MW plant yields 8760 MWh per year. To produce 29,000 TWh, need 29,000,000,000 MWh / 8760 MWh per MW = 3,311,000 MW of capacity. That's 3,311 GW. So need 3,311 GW of solar capacity. 100 miles on a side area: 100 miles * 100 miles = 10,000 square miles. 1 square mile = 2.59 km^2. So area = 25,900 km^2. Solar PV capacity per km^2? Roughly 1 MW per km^2? Actually typical solar PV capacity density ~ 0.5 to 1 MW per km^2. So 25,900 km^2 * 1 MW/km^2 = 25,900 MW. That's far less than 3,311,000 MW. So claim is false. But evidence: \"In 2002, this was more energy in one hour than the world used in one year.\" That seems contradictory. But we can still refute claim. The evidence about Ivanpah 392 MW is not enough to support claim. The claim is about 100 miles area. We don't have evidence that 100 miles area would produce 100% of US electricity. So we can say insufficient evidence? But we can refute because we can compute. But we only have evidence given. We have US energy consumption 29,000 TWh. We have Ivanpah 392 MW. We have no direct evidence about 100 miles area. But we can use the evidence to compute. But the instruction: \"You have additional evidence to consider in case you need it.\" So we can use the evidence to compute. So we can refute. So label FAIL. Confidence high. 0.95. Rationale empty.

We have evidence: multiple bullet points. Let's parse.\n\nEvidence bullet points:\n\n- [Antarctica] \"A 40-y record reveals gradual Antarctic sea ice increases followed by decreases at rates far exceeding the rates seen in the Arctic\". This refers to sea ice, not land ice. Sea ice increase then decrease. Not about land ice.\n\n- [Antarctica] found instead that the net change in ice mass is slightly positive at approximately 82 gigatonnes per year (with significant regional variation) which would result in Antarctic activity reducing global sea-level rise by 0.23 mm per year. This says net change in ice mass is slightly positive (i.e., mass gain). That would support claim that total ice sheet is increasing. But note: \"net change in ice mass\" includes both land ice and sea ice? Usually ice mass refers to land ice mass. But could include sea ice? Usually sea ice mass is separate. But the bullet says \"net change in ice mass\" maybe refers to land ice mass. So that supports claim.\n\n- [Antarctica] A satellite record revealed that the overall increase in Antarctic sea ice extents reversed in 2014, with rapid rates of decrease in 2014\u20132017 reducing the Antarctic sea ice extents to their lowest values in the 40-y record. This is about sea ice, not land ice. So not relevant.\n\n- [Sea level rise] All datasets generally show an acceleration of mass loss from the Antarctic ice-sheet, but with year-to-year variations.

That contradicts claim.\n\n- [Sea level rise] A 2019 study, however, using different methodology, concluded that East Antarctica is losing significant amounts of ice mass. This also contradicts claim.\n\nSo we have conflicting evidence: some support (net change slightly positive) and some refute (mass loss).

The claim is about \"total ice sheet, particularly that above land.\" The evidence about net change positive might refer to land ice mass. But the other evidence says mass loss. So overall evidence is contradictory. The claim is not strongly supported. The evidence does not conclusively support the claim. It also includes contradictory evidence. So classification likely NA? But we need to decide.\n\nThe instruction: \"Return NA ONLY if the provided evidence is genuinely insufficient to support or refute the claim. If the evidence explicitly supports the claim, choose PASS. If it explicitly contradicts the claim, choose FAIL.\"\n\nWe have evidence that explicitly contradicts the claim: \"All datasets generally show an acceleration of mass loss from the Antarctic ice-sheet\" and \"East Antarctica is losing significant amounts of ice mass.\" So that contradicts the claim that total ice sheet is increasing.

It only indicates that Pruitt was nominated as EPA Administrator, but not that he was selected to head the transition team. The claim might be partially supported if we interpret that Pruitt was selected to head the transition team. But the evidence does not explicitly state that.

But relative to current, 1945/46 global temperature was about 0.4\u00b0C cooler? Let's check: global temperature in 1945/46 was about 0.4\u00b0C cooler than present?

So claim says ECS estimate 1.5\u00b0C, probability range 1.05-2.45\u00b0C. This is narrower than IPCC ranges. IPCC says likely between 1.5-4.5\u00b0C, so 1.5 is lower bound of likely range. Probability range 1.05-2.45\u00b0C includes values below 1.5\u00b0C (1.05-1.49) which IPCC says extremely unlikely less than 1\u00b0C, but 1.05 is slightly above 1\u00b0C. IPCC says extremely unlikely less than 1\u00b0C, but 1.05 is above 1\u00b0C, so maybe not extremely unlikely. But IPCC says medium confidence likely between 1.5-4.5\u00b0C. So 1.05-2.45\u00b0C includes 1.05-1.49 which is below 1.5\u00b0C, which is outside the likely range. So claim's probability range includes values that IPCC says unlikely. So claim may be inconsistent with IPCC. But we need to see if evidence contradicts claim. The claim says ECS estimate 1.5\u00b0C, probability range 1.05-2.45\u00b0C. IPCC says likely between 1.5-4.5\u00b0C. So the claim's estimate is at lower bound of likely range. The probability range includes values below 1.5\u00b0C, which IPCC says unlikely. So claim is not fully supported by IPCC. But does IPCC explicitly contradict? It says \"medium confidence that ECS is likely between 1.5\u00b0C and 4.5\u00b0C\". That means probability that ECS is between 1.5 and 4.5 is high. The claim says probability range 1.05-2.45. That is narrower and includes lower values. IPCC does not say ECS is unlikely between 1.05-1.49. It says extremely unlikely less than 1\u00b0C, but 1.05 is above 1\u00b0C. So IPCC does not explicitly say ECS unlikely between 1.05-1.49. So claim might be partially supported? But IPCC says \"very likely >1.5\u00b0C\" and \"likely 2-4.5\u00b0C\". So claim's estimate 1.5\u00b0C is at lower bound of likely. But IPCC says \"very likely >1.5\u00b0C\" meaning >1.5\u00b0C is more likely. So claim's estimate 1.5\u00b0C is not \"very likely\". So claim is not fully supported. But is it contradicted? IPCC says \"very likely >1.5\u00b0C\" meaning >1.5\u00b0C is more likely than <=1.5\u00b0C. So claim's estimate 1.5\u00b0C is not \"very likely\". So claim is not supported. But is it contradicted? IPCC says \"likely 2-4.5\u00b0C\" which is higher than 1.5\u00b0C. So claim's estimate 1.5\u00b0C is lower than likely range. So claim is not supported. But does IPCC explicitly say ECS unlikely to be 1.5\u00b0C? It says \"very likely >1.5\u00b0C\". That means probability of >1.5\u00b0C is high. But probability of exactly 1.5\u00b0C is not given. But claim says estimate 1.5\u00b0C. That is plausible but not strongly supported. The probability range 1.05-2.45 includes 1.5-2.45. That is partially overlapping with IPCC's likely range 1.5-4.5. So claim is not contradicted but not strongly supported. So we might choose NA: insufficient evidence. But we have evidence that IPCC says likely 2-4.5\u00b0C, so claim's estimate 1.5\u00b0C is lower than likely. So claim is not supported. But is it contradicted? IPCC says \"very likely >1.5\u00b0C\" meaning >1.5\u00b0C is more likely. So claim's estimate 1.5\u00b0C is not \"very likely\". But that doesn't necessarily contradict. But the claim's probability range includes values below 1.5\u00b0C, which IPCC says unlikely? IPCC says extremely unlikely less than 1\u00b0C, but 1.05-1.49 is not extremely unlikely.

We know global sea level rise since 1880 is about 8 inches? Let's recall: According to NOAA, global mean sea level rise since 1880 is about 8 inches (~20 cm). Yes, roughly 8 inches.

That is plausible.\n\n\"this can be compensated by the cooling effect on the atmosphere due to fewer clouds trapping less warmth and fewer absorbing aerosols absorbing less sunlight.\" So fewer clouds means less greenhouse effect (less warmth trapped). Fewer absorbing aerosols means less warming of atmosphere. So cooling effect on atmosphere. So net effect: more sunlight at surface but cooling effect on atmosphere. So claim is basically that changes in cloud cover and aerosols can lead to more sunlight at surface but also cooling effect on atmosphere due to less greenhouse effect.\n\nNow evidence: \n- Climate system: Some scatter sunlight and cool the planet, others absorb and warm atmosphere.

This partially supports claim that aerosols can reduce sunlight at surface, but claim says changes lead to more sunlight hitting surface. So evidence contradicts that part? Wait: global dimming says particles reflect and absorb sunlight, less sun rays reach Earth surface layers, resulting in cooler surface temperatures. That means aerosols reduce sunlight at surface. But claim says changes in cloud cover & aerosols lead to more sunlight hitting surface. That would be opposite: if aerosols decrease, more sunlight reaches surface. But evidence says aerosols reflect and absorb sunlight, reducing sunlight at surface. So if aerosols increase, less sunlight at surface. But claim says changes lead to more sunlight hitting surface. That could be due to decreased aerosols or decreased cloud cover. So evidence doesn't directly contradict claim; it just says aerosols reflect and absorb sunlight, reducing sunlight at surface. But claim says changes lead to more sunlight hitting surface. That could be due to decreased aerosols or decreased cloud cover. So evidence doesn't necessarily contradict claim; it's consistent if we interpret changes as decreases in aerosols or cloud cover. But evidence also says less cloud formation due to aerosols, which leads to less cloud cover, which leads to more sunlight at surface. So evidence supports claim that changes in aerosols can lead to less cloud formation, leading to more sunlight at surface. So evidence supports claim.\n\n- Global warming: If cloud cover increases, more sunlight will be reflected back into space, cooling the planet.

So evidence supports claim that changes in cloud cover can lead to more sunlight at surface.\n\n- Global warming: For instance, change from dark forest to grassland makes surface lighter, reflecting more sunlight. This is about surface albedo, not aerosols or clouds. But it indicates more sunlight reflected back to space, cooling.

Also Earth's magnetic field deflects cosmic rays. Svensmark argued solar variation modulates cosmic ray flux, affecting cloud formation, indirect cause of global warming.
