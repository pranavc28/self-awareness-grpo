Let's parse evidence:\n\n- Botany: concentration of CO2 today is much lower than it was when plants emerged onto land during Ordovician and Silurian periods. That says today lower than ancient times, not about 160 years ago.\n\n- Eocene: proxies indicate at maximum global warmth CO2 700-900 ppm, other proxies indicate large changes of CO2 of over 2000 ppm over <1 million years.

But does evidence support that we should worry about warming impacts in next 100 years? Evidence bullet 3: \"Global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 were equivalent to 49 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide.\" This indicates emissions. Bullet 4: \"Current projected consequences of global warming include a largely ice-free Arctic Ocean within 5\u201320 years.\" This indicates warming impacts in next 5-20 years. Bullet 5: \"Projections based on the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios suggest warming over the 21st century at a more rapid rate than that experienced for at least the last 10,000 years.\" This indicates warming in 21st century. So evidence supports that warming impacts are happening now and will continue. So evidence supports claim that we should worry about warming impacts in next 100 years. So evidence supports claim. So PASS.\n\nConfidence: evidence explicitly states greenhouse gases will prevent next ice age, and warming impacts in next 5-20 years. So claim is supported. So high confidence. 0.90-0.99.

That indicates warming after 1880, but doesn't directly address Industrial Revolution period (roughly 1750-1900). It says warming since 1880, but not before.

[Climate change in Australia] He says that the drought in Australia is already 8 years long.\n\n4. [Drought] The long Australian Millennial drought broke in 2010.\n\n5. [Physical impacts of climate change] In addition, many areas are experiencing higher than normal droughts.\n\nWe need to see if evidence supports claim that the drought was misinterpreted as a long term trend due to climate change. Evidence: 1 says climate change is long-term patterns. 2 says adaptation to short-term variability may cause maladaptation to longer-term trends. 3 says drought already 8 years long. 4 says drought broke in 2010. 5 says many areas experiencing higher than normal droughts.\n\nDoes evidence entail claim? Claim: misinterpreted as long term trend due to climate change. Evidence does not explicitly say misinterpretation. It says drought is long, but not that it was misinterpreted. 2 suggests adaptation to short-term variability may cause maladaptation to longer-term trends, but not misinterpretation. So evidence does not support claim. Does it contradict? No, evidence doesn't say it's not misinterpreted. So neutral. So NA.\n\nConfidence? Evidence insufficient. So low confidence maybe 0.55. But guidelines: 0.50-0.59 borderline. So choose 0.55. Rationale empty. Let's output.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>LABEL=NA\nCONF=0.55\nRATIONALE="

Not directly about absorption.\n\n- Oceans act as enormous carbon sink, taken up about a third of CO2 emitted by human activity. That implies about 9.7 billion tons per year (a third of 29). But claim says increasing by about 2 billion tons per year. This evidence says oceans absorb about a third, but not about rate of increase. Could be consistent but not explicit.\n\n- As concentration increases, increased uptake causing measurable decrease in pH. Not about rate.\n\n- Current annual increase in atmospheric CO2 approx 4 gigatons of carbon. That's 4 billion tons per year increase in atmospheric CO2. Not about absorption.\n\n- Carbon dioxide is absorbed from atmosphere at ocean's surface at exchange rate varies locally but on average, oceans have net absorption of CO2 2.2 Pg C per year. 2.2 Pg C = 2.2 billion tons of carbon?

In technical sources, climate change refers to past and future climate changes that persist for extended period, includes regional changes as well as global change. NOAA, IPCC definitions.\n\nSo evidence indicates that terms are used interchangeably, but also that climate change has broader meaning. Claim: they mean different things and have both been used for decades. Evidence: yes, they have both been used for decades (1950s). They mean different things? Evidence says they are often used interchangeably, but also that climate change refers to broader changes. So evidence suggests they are not exactly same but overlapping. Claim says they mean different things. Evidence indicates they are often used interchangeably, but also that climate change includes regional changes. So evidence partially supports difference but also interchangeability. Claim: \"Global warming' and 'climate change' mean different things and have both been used for decades.\" Evidence: yes used for decades. Means different? Evidence: yes climate change broader, but global warming is subset. So evidence supports difference. So claim is entailed? The evidence says they are often used interchangeably, but also that climate change refers to broader changes. That implies difference. So claim is supported. So PASS. Confidence maybe 0.75.

Let's parse.\n\n- Cellulosic ethanol: \"The production of cellulosic ethanol represents not only a step toward true energy diversity for the country, but a very cost-effective alternative to fossil fuels.\" This suggests renewable (cellulosic ethanol) is cost-effective alternative. That supports claim? Claim says unlikely to exceed 15-20% until we develop practical cost-competitive alternative. This evidence says cellulosic ethanol is cost-effective alternative, implying that renewable could be cost-competitive? That would contradict claim? Wait claim says unlikely to exceed 15-20% until we develop practical cost-competitive alternative. If cellulosic ethanol is cost-effective alternative, that suggests we already have a cost-competitive alternative, which would mean renewable could exceed 15-20%? But claim says unlikely until we develop such alternative. So evidence contradicts claim? But evidence says cellulosic ethanol is cost-effective alternative, but claim says until we develop a practical cost-competitive alternative, unlikely to exceed 15-20%. If cellulosic ethanol is cost-effective, that might mean we already have a cost-competitive alternative, so claim would be false. But evidence may not directly say that renewable energy will exceed 15-20%. It just says cellulosic ethanol is cost-effective alternative. That could support claim that renewable energy is cost-effective alternative, but claim says unlikely to exceed 15-20% until we develop practical cost-competitive alternative. So evidence suggests we already have cost-competitive alternative, which would contradict claim. But evidence also includes nuclear power debate: \"In practical terms non-hydro renewables are therefore able to supply up to some 15\u201320% of the capacity of an electricity grid, though they cannot directly be applied as economic substitutes for most coal or nuclear power, however significant they become in particular areas with favourable conditions.\" This says non-hydro renewables can supply up to 15-20% of capacity. That supports claim that renewable energy cannot exceed 15-20%? Actually claim says unlikely to exceed 15-20% until we develop cost-competitive alternative. This evidence says non-hydro renewables can supply up to 15-20% of capacity. That supports claim that renewable energy cannot exceed 15-20%? It says up to 15-20% of capacity. That is consistent with claim. So evidence supports claim.\n\nRenewable energy: \"biofuels have potential to meet more than a quarter of world demand for transportation fuels by 2050.\" That suggests renewable could exceed 15-20%? But claim is about global energy requirements, not just transportation fuels. This evidence suggests renewable could exceed 15-20% of transportation fuels, but claim is about global energy requirements. So not directly contradictory.\n\nRenewable energy: \"National renewable energy markets projected to grow strongly... 20% target of all electricity generated for EU by 2020.\" That suggests renewable could exceed 15-20% of electricity generation. But claim is about global energy requirements. So not directly contradictory.\n\nRenewable energy: \"Globally, the long-term technical potential of wind energy is believed to be five times total current global energy production, or 40 times current electricity demand, assuming all practical barriers needed were overcome.\" That suggests renewable could exceed 15-20% if barriers overcome. But claim says unlikely until we develop cost-competitive alternative. This evidence suggests potential is high, but not necessarily cost-competitive. So not contradictory.\n\nThus evidence is mixed: some support claim, some not directly contradictory. The claim is about global energy requirements, not just electricity. Evidence includes cellulosic ethanol cost-effective alternative, which might contradict claim. But claim says unlikely until we develop practical cost-competitive alternative. If cellulosic ethanol is cost-effective alternative, that might mean we already have cost-competitive alternative, so claim would be false. But evidence does not explicitly say that renewable energy will exceed 15-20% or not. It just says cellulosic ethanol is cost-effective alternative. That could be interpreted as evidence that renewable energy is cost-competitive, which would contradict claim. But the claim is about likelihood of exceeding 15-20% until we develop cost-competitive alternative. If we already have cost-competitive alternative, then claim is false. So evidence contradicts claim.\n\nBut we need to decide: does evidence contradict claim? The evidence includes a statement that non-hydro renewables can supply up to 15-20% of capacity. That supports claim. But claim says unlikely to exceed 15-20% until we develop cost-competitive alternative. That is consistent with evidence that non-hydro renewables supply up to 15-20%. So evidence supports claim. But cellulosic ethanol cost-effective alternative might contradict claim. But claim is about likelihood of exceeding 15-20% until we develop cost-competitive alternative. If cellulosic ethanol is cost-effective alternative, that might mean we already have cost-competitive alternative, so claim would be false. But evidence does not say that renewable energy will exceed 15-20% or not. It just says cellulosic ethanol is cost-effective alternative. That could be interpreted as evidence that renewable energy is cost-competitive, which would contradict claim. But the claim is about likelihood of exceeding 15-20% until we develop cost-competitive alternative. If we already have cost-competitive alternative, then claim is false. So evidence contradicts claim.\n\nBut we need to decide if evidence contradicts claim or not. The evidence is mixed. The claim is about global energy requirements. The evidence includes some statements about electricity grid capacity, transportation fuels, etc. None of them directly state that renewable energy will exceed 15-20% of global energy requirements. The evidence does not directly contradict claim. It also does not directly support claim. So maybe neutral.\n\nGiven guidelines: choose PASS only if evidence provides clear support for claim. Choose FAIL only if evidence provides clear support for claim being false. Choose NA when evidence is unrelated, insufficient, or does not bear on claim's truth value.\n\nHere evidence is partially supportive but not conclusive. The claim is about global energy requirements. Evidence includes some statements about electricity grid capacity and potential. But not directly about global energy requirements.

So not directly contradictory.\n\n2. \"This effect results in the increased absorption of radiation that accelerates melting.\" Which effect? Probably refers to previous bullet? Might refer to increased absorption of radiation due to less reflection? Hard to parse. But says increased absorption accelerates melting. That supports claim that more absorption leads to warming. But not necessarily about planet becoming less reflective.\n\n3. \"For instance, the change from a dark forest to grassland makes the surface lighter, causing it to reflect more sunlight.\" This says change to lighter surface increases reflection, not less reflective. Contradicts claim? Claim says less reflective. This bullet says more reflective. So contradictory.\n\n4. \"In the tropics the net effect is to produce a significant warming, while at latitudes closer to the poles a loss of albedo leads to an overall cooling effect.\" This says at poles loss of albedo leads to cooling. That is contradictory to claim that planet overall less reflective leading to warming. But maybe overall warming? This bullet says net effect in tropics warming, but at poles cooling. So overall? Not clear.\n\n5. \"Not only does this increase the absorption of sunlight, it also increases melting and sea level rise.\" This supports claim that increased absorption leads to warming.\n\nSo evidence is mixed: some bullets support claim (2,5), some contradict (1,3,4). The claim: \"planet as a whole is becoming less reflective and absorbing more sunlight, which is accelerating global warming.\" Evidence: not clear that planet as a whole is becoming less reflective. Some bullets say more reflection. So evidence does not entail claim. Does it contradict? Some bullets contradict. But evidence is not conclusive. So likely NA.\n\nThus label NA. Confidence maybe 0.65? Because evidence partially contradictory. So choose NA with 0.65. Rationale empty.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>LABEL=NA\nCONF=0.65\nRATIONALE="

Let's parse.\n\n- Air pollution: Even in areas with low levels, public health effects can be significant and costly, since many people breathe pollutants. This supports that burning fossil fuels causes health costs.\n\n- Fossil fuel: Fossil fuel prices generally are below their actual costs, or their \"efficient prices,\" when economic externalities, such as the costs of air pollution and global climate destruction, are taken into account. This says that fossil fuel prices are below actual costs when externalities considered. That supports claim that fossil fuels are more expensive when externalities included.\n\n- Fossil fuel: Artificial gasolines and other renewable energy sources currently require more expensive production and processing technologies than conventional petroleum reserves, but may become economically viable in the near future. This says renewable energy currently more expensive to produce than conventional petroleum, but may become viable. This is somewhat contradictory to claim that renewables are cheaper. But claim says \"most renewable energy sources\" are cheaper. Evidence says renewable currently more expensive production and processing technologies than conventional petroleum. That contradicts claim? Wait claim: \"they are significantly more expensive than most renewable energy sources.\" So claim says renewables cheaper. Evidence says renewables currently require more expensive production and processing technologies than conventional petroleum. That suggests renewables are more expensive, contradicting claim. But evidence also says may become economically viable in near future. But still currently more expensive. So evidence contradicts claim.\n\n- Nuclear power: Today's primary sources of energy are mainly non-renewable: natural gas, oil, coal, peat, and conventional nuclear power. This just states current sources.\n\n- Renewable energy: It would also reduce environmental pollution such as air pollution caused by burning of fossil fuels and improve public health, reduce premature mortalities due to pollution and save associated health costs that amount to several hundred billion dollars annually only in the United States. This supports claim that renewables reduce pollution and health costs.\n\nSo evidence is mixed: some support claim (air pollution costs, externalities, health cost savings from renewables). Some contradict claim (renewables currently more expensive production). The claim is about \"when you account for all costs associated with burning coal and other fossil fuels, like air pollution and health effects, in reality they are significantly more expensive than most renewable energy sources.\" That is basically saying that when externalities considered, fossil fuels are more expensive than most renewables. Evidence: first bullet supports that externalities cause costs. Second bullet supports that fossil fuel prices below actual costs when externalities considered. Third bullet says renewables currently more expensive production and processing technologies than conventional petroleum. That contradicts claim. But maybe the claim is about overall cost including externalities, not just production cost. The third bullet says renewables currently require more expensive production and processing technologies than conventional petroleum reserves, but may become economically viable. That suggests that currently renewables are more expensive to produce, but claim says they are cheaper when externalities considered. The evidence doesn't directly address overall cost including externalities for renewables. So evidence is partially supportive but also contradictory. The question: determine relationship between evidence and claim: PASS, FAIL, or NA.\n\nWe need to see if evidence entails claim, contradicts claim, or neutral.\n\nGiven evidence includes contradictory bullet, we cannot say evidence entails claim. Does evidence contradict claim? The third bullet says renewables currently more expensive production and processing technologies than conventional petroleum. That contradicts claim that renewables are cheaper. But claim is about \"most renewable energy sources\" being cheaper when accounting for externalities. The evidence says renewables currently more expensive production and processing technologies. That is a direct contradiction. So evidence contradicts claim. But we must consider if evidence is neutral? The evidence is mixed. But the presence of a direct contradiction likely leads to FAIL. According to guidelines: choose FAIL if evidence provides clear support for claim being false.

Let's parse.\n\n- [Climate change (general concept)] The term \"climate change\" is often used to refer specifically to anthropogenic climate change (also known as global warming).\n- [Global warming] Research in the 1950s suggested that temperatures were increasing, and a 1952 newspaper used the term \"climate change\".\n- [Global warming] Both the terms global warming and climate change were used only occasionally until 1975, when Wallace Smith Broecker published a scientific paper on the topic, \"Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?\".\n- [Global warming] Oxford Dictionary chose climate emergency as the word of the year 2019 and defines the term as \"a situation in which urgent action is required to reduce or halt climate change and avoid potentially irreversible environmental damage resulting from it\".\n- [Global warming] This is much colder than the conditions that actually exist at the Earth's surface (the global mean surface temperature is about 14\u202f\u00b0C).\n\nWe need to determine relationship between evidence and claim. Claim: They changed the name from \"global warming\" to \"climate change\" after the term global warming just wasn\u2019t working (it was too cold)!\n\nEssentially claim says: The name changed because global warming term was not working, because it was too cold. So claim is that the term \"global warming\" was replaced by \"climate change\" because the term \"global warming\" was too cold (i.e., not accurate). Evidence: bullet points show that climate change is often used to refer to anthropogenic climate change (also known as global warming). That indicates that climate change is used to refer to global warming. But does evidence support claim that name changed because global warming was too cold? Not directly. Evidence shows that both terms used occasionally until 1975, then Broecker paper. No mention of name change due to \"too cold\". Also evidence includes a statement about global mean surface temperature 14\u00b0C, but that is not about term being too cold. So evidence does not support claim. It does not contradict claim either? It doesn't say that name didn't change or that it changed for other reasons. But claim is about reason for name change. Evidence does not mention reason. So evidence is neutral.

Actually \"rounded out by\" suggests that the top five list includes those four countries as the last four? But top five would have five countries; \"rounded out by China, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Germany\" implies those four countries are the last four of the top five? But top five would have five countries; maybe the top five list includes some other country plus those four? The claim says \"The top five countries for passenger aviation-related carbon emissions were rounded out by China, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Germany.\" That implies that the top five list includes those four countries as the last four, but we don't know the first one. So the claim is that the top five list includes China, UK, Japan, Germany. So the claim is that those four countries are among the top five for passenger aviation-related carbon emissions.\n\nNow evidence: We have bullet points:\n\n- UK: Air transport in the UK accounted for 6.3% of all UK carbon emissions in 2006. That indicates UK has aviation emissions but not necessarily top five globally.\n\n- Europe average fuel consumption per passenger etc. Not about top five.\n\n- Germany: \"Nevertheless, the country's total greenhouse gas emissions were the highest in the EU in 2017.\" That indicates Germany high emissions but not necessarily top five globally.\n\n- \"Over this time period, the US accounted for 28% of emissions; the EU, 23%; Russia, 11%; China, 9%; other OECD countries, 5%; Japan, 4%; India, 3%; and the rest of the world, 18%.\" This bullet seems to refer to emissions overall, not specifically aviation.

Claim: lead authors are experts in their field, instructed to fairly represent full range of up-to-date peer-reviewed literature.

Also instructed to fairly represent full range of up-to-date peer-reviewed literature? Evidence says authors should give priority to peer-reviewed sources, assess published literature including peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed. It doesn't explicitly say \"fairly represent full range\" but implies they assess literature. The claim says \"instructed to fairly represent the full range of the up-to-date, peer-reviewed literature.\" Evidence says they should give priority to peer-reviewed sources, but not explicitly \"fairly represent full range.\" However, the IPCC guidelines likely include fairness. But evidence only says priority to peer-reviewed sources. That may be enough to support claim? The claim includes two parts: experts in their field, and instructed to fairly represent full range of up-to-date peer-reviewed literature. Evidence: selection aims for range of views, expertise, geographical representation. That supports experts. Also \"authors should give priority to peer-reviewed sources\" supports instruction to represent peer-reviewed literature. But \"fairly represent full range\" is not explicitly stated. But \"fairly represent the full range\" could be inferred from \"authors should give priority to peer-reviewed sources\" and \"assess published literature including peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed sources.\" That suggests they consider full range. But not explicit. The evidence may be considered to entail the claim? The claim is fairly strong: \"instructed to fairly represent the full range of the up-to-date, peer-reviewed literature.\" Evidence: \"authors should give priority to peer-reviewed sources.\" That implies they are instructed to consider peer-reviewed literature. But \"fairly represent the full range\" is not explicitly stated. However, the evidence does say \"lead authors assess the available information about climate change based on published sources\" and \"rather, it assesses published literature, including peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed sources.\" That indicates they consider all published literature. So they are instructed to fairly represent full range? Possibly yes. The evidence supports that they assess published literature, including peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed, and give priority to peer-reviewed sources. That implies they are instructed to fairly represent the full range of peer-reviewed literature. So evidence likely entails claim. But we need to be careful: The claim says \"instructed to fairly represent the full range of the up-to-date, peer-reviewed literature.\" Evidence says \"authors should give priority to peer-reviewed sources.\" That is a partial instruction. It doesn't explicitly mention \"fairly represent the full range\" or \"up-to-date.\" But \"up-to-date\" might be implied by \"peer-reviewed literature\" which is up-to-date. But not explicit. So maybe evidence is neutral? But guidelines: \"Focus ONLY on what the evidence explicitly states or directly implies.\" The evidence does not explicitly state \"fairly represent the full range of the up-to-date, peer-reviewed literature.\" It only says \"authors should give priority to peer-reviewed sources.\" That is not the same as \"fairly represent the full range.\" So evidence does not entail claim. It also does not contradict claim. So NA. But we need to decide. The claim: \"The IPCC lead authors are experts in their field, instructed to fairly represent the full range of the up-to-date, peer-reviewed literature.\" Evidence: selection aims for range of views, expertise, geographical representation. That supports experts. Also \"authors should give priority to peer-reviewed sources.\" That supports instruction to represent peer-reviewed literature. But \"fairly represent the full range\" is not explicitly stated. But \"fairly represent\" could be inferred from \"authors should give priority to peer-reviewed sources\" and \"assess published literature including peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed sources.\" That implies they consider all literature fairly.

Let's parse.\n\nEvidence bullet 1: \"Despite this, Jupiter still radiates more heat than it receives from the Sun; the amount of heat produced inside it is similar to the total solar radiation it receives.\" This says Jupiter radiates more heat than it receives, but amount of heat produced inside is similar to total solar radiation it receives. So internal heat production similar to solar radiation. Not necessarily twice as much. So evidence says internal heat production similar to solar radiation, not twice. So claim says radiates twice as much energy as it receives. Evidence says radiates more heat than it receives, but internal heat production similar to solar radiation. That seems contradictory? Let's analyze: Radiates more heat than receives. That means total radiated > solar received. But internal heat production similar to solar radiation. So internal heat production ~ solar radiation. So total radiated = solar radiation + internal heat production ~ 2 * solar radiation. So evidence implies radiated ~ 2 * solar radiation. So claim that radiates twice as much energy as it receives is supported. But bullet says \"the amount of heat produced inside it is similar to the total solar radiation it receives.\" That means internal heat production ~ solar radiation. So radiated energy = solar radiation + internal heat production ~ 2 * solar radiation. So claim is entailed. But bullet says \"Despite this, Jupiter still radiates more heat than it receives from the Sun; the amount of heat produced inside it is similar to the total solar radiation it receives.\" That is consistent with claim. So evidence supports claim.\n\nBut we must check other bullets: bullet 2: \"The water clouds are assumed to generate thunderstorms in the same way as terrestrial thunderstorms, driven by the heat rising from the interior.\" This supports internal heat driving weather. bullet 3: \"Jupiter's low axial tilt means that the poles constantly receive less solar radiation than at the planet's equatorial region.\" bullet 4: \"Convection within the interior of the planet transports more energy to the poles, balancing out the temperatures at the cloud layer.\" bullet 5: Neptune info.

Carbon dioxide: \"Increases in atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases such as methane, nitrous oxide and ozone have correspondingly strengthened their absorption and emission of infrared radiation, causing the rise in average global temperature since the mid-20th century.\" This says that increases in CO2 cause rise in average global temperature since mid-20th century. That suggests warming, not cooling. So evidence contradicts claim? But claim says cooling during 1940-1976 despite increasing CO2. Evidence says CO2 increases cause rise in temperature since mid-20th century. That contradicts claim. So evidence contradicts claim.\n\nBut we must check other bullets.\n\n2. Climate sensitivity: \"Climate sensitivity is the globally averaged temperature change in response to changes in radiative forcing, which can occur, for instance, due to increased levels of carbon dioxide (CO2).\" This is just definition, no claim about cooling.\n\n3.

That supports claim of cooling. But also says possibility of large scale warming due to emissions. So evidence partially supports cooling but also acknowledges warming possibility. But does it contradict? Not necessarily. It says cooling since 1945. That is consistent with claim of cooling 1940-1976. So evidence supports claim.\n\n4. Global cooling: \"The general public had little awareness of carbon dioxide's effects on climate, but Science News in May 1959 forecast a 25% increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide in the 150 years from 1850 to 2000, with a consequent warming trend.\" This says forecast warming trend due to CO2 increase. That contradicts claim of cooling despite increasing CO2. But it's a forecast, not observation. But still indicates expectation of warming.\n\n5. Ice age: definition of ice age. Not relevant.\n\nSo evidence is mixed: some bullets support cooling, some support warming. The claim: \"During the period 1940 to 1976 there was a cooling of the climate despite increasing CO2 levels.\" We need to determine relationship: entailed, contradicted, or neutral.\n\nWe must consider evidence as a whole. The evidence includes statements that global temperatures showed cooling since 1945 (support claim) and that CO2 increases cause warming (contradict claim). The claim says cooling despite increasing CO2. The evidence says CO2 increases cause warming, but also says cooling observed. So evidence is contradictory: some support, some contradict. But does evidence contradict the claim? The claim says cooling despite increasing CO2. Evidence says CO2 increases cause warming, but also says cooling observed. So evidence does not outright contradict claim; it provides both support and contradiction. The claim could still be true: cooling observed, CO2 increased, but warming effect not observed. Evidence says CO2 increases cause warming, but that is a general statement, not necessarily that warming must be observed. So evidence does not necessarily contradict claim. It might be neutral.\n\nBut we need to decide: The evidence includes a bullet that says \"Increases in atmospheric concentrations of CO2 ... causing the rise in average global temperature since the mid-20th century.\" That is a direct statement that CO2 increases cause rise in temperature. That contradicts claim that cooling occurred despite increasing CO2. But the claim is about observed cooling, not about cause. The evidence says CO2 increases cause rise in temperature. That suggests that if CO2 increased, temperature should rise, but observed cooling contradicts that. So evidence contradicts claim? But the evidence is a general statement about cause, not about observed data. But the claim is about observed cooling. The evidence says CO2 increases cause rise in temperature. That is a causal claim. If we accept evidence, then claim that cooling occurred despite increasing CO2 is inconsistent with evidence. So evidence contradicts claim.\n\nBut we also have evidence that says cooling observed since 1945. That supports claim. So evidence is contradictory. The guidelines: choose PASS if evidence entails claim. FAIL if evidence contradicts claim. NA if evidence neutral.\n\nGiven evidence is contradictory, we cannot say claim is entailed or contradicted. But we need to decide if evidence contradicts claim. The evidence includes a statement that CO2 increases cause rise in temperature. That is a direct contradiction to claim that cooling occurred despite increasing CO2. But the claim is about observed cooling, not about cause. But the evidence says cause leads to warming. That is a direct contradiction. So evidence contradicts claim.\n\nBut we also have evidence that says cooling observed. That supports claim. So evidence is mixed. The guidelines: \"Choose FAIL only if the evidence provides clear support for the claim being false.\" The evidence does provide support for claim being false: CO2 increases cause warming. So claim that cooling occurred despite increasing CO2 is false. So evidence contradicts claim. So label FAIL.\n\nConfidence: moderate. Because evidence is contradictory.

Wait tropical deforestation is a subset of all deforestation. So if tropical deforestation alone accounts for 20% of world GHG emissions, then total deforestation would be at least 20%. So claim of 11% is lower. So evidence contradicts claim. But we need to see if evidence contradicts or is neutral. The claim says 11% of all global GHG emissions caused by humans are caused by deforestation. Evidence says tropical deforestation accounts for 20% of world GHG emissions. That is contradictory because 20% > 11%. So evidence contradicts claim.\n\nBut we must check other bullet points: \"Of these emissions, 65% was carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning and industry, 11% was carbon dioxide from land use change, which is primarily due to deforestation, 16% was from methane, 6.2% was from nitrous oxide, and 2.0% was from fluorinated gases.\" This bullet says 11% of emissions from land use change, primarily due to deforestation. That matches claim: 11% from deforestation. So evidence supports claim. Wait but earlier bullet says tropical deforestation 20%. So contradictory evidence within evidence. But we need to decide overall relationship. The evidence includes contradictory statements. But we need to see if evidence contradicts claim. The claim: 11% of all global GHG emissions caused by humans are caused by deforestation. Evidence: bullet 2 says 11% from land use change, primarily due to deforestation. That supports claim. Bullet 1 says tropical deforestation 20% of world GHG emissions. That contradicts claim. So evidence is inconsistent. But we need to decide relationship: does evidence contradict claim? The evidence includes both support and contradiction. But we need to decide if evidence contradicts claim. The guidelines: choose FAIL if evidence provides clear support for claim being false. But evidence is contradictory. But we need to see if evidence overall contradicts claim. The evidence includes a bullet that says 20% of world GHG emissions from tropical deforestation. That is a clear statement that deforestation accounts for 20% of emissions, which contradicts claim of 11%. So evidence contradicts claim. So label FAIL.\n\nConfidence? The evidence is explicit. So high confidence. But guidelines: we should not default to high confidence if ambiguous. But here evidence is explicit. So 0.95 maybe. But guidelines: 0.90-0.99: evidence explicit and unambiguous.

Let's parse.\n\n- \"Americans\" bullet: \"Furthermore, there are approximately 40,000 Americans living and working in the Kingdom.\" Not relevant.\n\n- \"Economy of the United Kingdom\" bullet: \"The industry employs around 113,000 people directly and around 276,000 indirectly and has an annual turnover of around \u00a320 billion.\" Not relevant.\n\n- \"Infrastructure policy of Donald Trump\" bullet: \"While the traditional fossil fuel industry employed 187,000 jobs in 2016, the wind power industry grew by nearly 32% to 102,000 people.\" Not relevant.\n\n- \"Infrastructure policy of Donald Trump\" bullet: \"At the same time, the solar power industry grew by almost a quarter to 374,000 jobs.\" This says solar power industry grew to 374,000 jobs. That is >260,000. So evidence supports claim that >260,000 Americans employed by domestic solar industry. But does it say domestic? It says solar power industry grew to 374,000 jobs. Likely domestic. So evidence supports.\n\n- \"Presidency of Donald Trump\" bullet: \"The American solar energy industry is highly reliant on foreign parts (80% of parts are made abroad); as a result, the tariffs could raise the costs of solar energy, reduce innovation and reduce jobs in the industry\u2014which in 2017 employed nearly four times as many American workers as the coal industry.\" This says in 2017 employed nearly four times as many American workers as the coal industry. That supports claim that solar industry employed more than coal. But does it give numbers? It says nearly four times as many. So if coal industry had X, solar had ~4X. But we need >260,000. If coal had 65k, solar 260k. But we don't know coal numbers. But earlier bullet says fossil fuel industry employed 187,000 jobs in 2016. That might be coal? But \"traditional fossil fuel industry\" includes coal, oil, gas. So not specific. But the claim says \"entire coal mining industry\". We don't have coal mining industry numbers. So evidence does not give coal mining industry number. So we cannot confirm \"three times as many workers as employed by the entire coal mining industry.\" But we have evidence that solar employed nearly four times as many American workers as the coal industry. That implies solar > coal. But we don't know coal number. But we can infer that solar > coal. But claim says \"three times as many workers as employed by the entire coal mining industry.\" That is a specific ratio. Evidence says \"nearly four times as many American workers as the coal industry.\" That is close to 4 times. So evidence supports ratio of about 4 times. So claim says 3 times. So evidence supports that ratio is at least 3 times. So evidence supports claim.\n\nThus evidence supports claim. So PASS.\n\nConfidence: evidence explicitly states solar 374k jobs. That is >260k.

Let's parse.\n\n- Fossil-fueled power plants, which wind turbines generally require to make up for their weather dependent intermittency, kill almost 20 times as many birds per gigawatt hour (GWh) of electricity according to Sovacool. This says fossil-fueled plants kill more birds per GWh than wind turbines? Wait: \"kill almost 20 times as many birds per GWh of electricity\" - but refers to fossil-fueled plants. So evidence says fossil-fueled plants kill more birds per GWh than wind turbines. That contradicts claim that wind turbines slice and dice birds. So evidence contradicts that part.\n\n- Human impact on the environment: insects accumulate toxins in exoskeletons and pass them to insectivorous birds and bats. This is about toxins in insects, not directly about wind turbines. Not relevant.\n\n- Raptor conservation: birds of prey at high risk of secondary poisoning by eating organisms killed or debilitated by pesticides. Not about wind turbines.\n\n- Wind turbine: Thousands of birds, including rare species, have been killed by the blades of wind turbines, though wind turbines contribute relatively insignificantly to anthropogenic avian mortality. This says wind turbines kill thousands of birds, but insignificantly relative to anthropogenic mortality. So evidence partially supports claim that wind turbines kill birds, but also says insignificantly. Claim says slice and dice birds and bats. Evidence says thousands killed but insignificantly. So evidence partially supports but also contradicts magnitude.\n\n- Wind turbine damaging Australia's Great Barrier Reef and by water acidification from combustion monoxides. This seems unrelated.\n\nThus evidence does not fully support claim. It contradicts some aspects (fossil plants kill more birds per GWh). Also evidence says wind turbines kill thousands but insignificantly. Claim says they are environmentally disastrous. Evidence does not mention toxins around turbine site, land area, health problems for humans, despoil landscape. So evidence is neutral or contradictory. So choose NA? But we need to see if evidence contradicts claim. Claim: \"Renewables such as wind turbines are environmentally disastrous because they pollute a huge land area, slice and dice birds and bats, kill insects that are bird food, create health problems for humans who live within kilometres of them, leave toxins around the turbine site and despoil the landscape.\"\n\nEvidence: only mentions birds killed, but says insignificantly. Also says fossil plants kill more birds per GWh. So evidence contradicts claim that wind turbines slice and dice birds and bats? It says thousands killed but insignificantly. So evidence contradicts the claim that wind turbines are environmentally disastrous? Not fully. But evidence does not support the claim that they pollute huge land area, kill insects, create health problems, leave toxins, despoil landscape. So evidence is neutral or contradictory. According to guidelines, choose FAIL if evidence provides clear support for claim being false. Evidence does provide support that wind turbines kill fewer birds per GWh than fossil plants, and insignificantly. That contradicts claim that they slice and dice birds.

Actually \"CO2 limits won't cool the planet\" suggests that setting limits on CO2 (like reducing CO2) will not cause cooling. Evidence: first bullet: \"Less energy reaches the upper atmosphere, which is therefore cooler because of this absorption.\" That refers to CO2 absorption causing less energy reaching upper atmosphere, making it cooler. That suggests CO2 causes cooling of upper atmosphere? But claim about limits won't cool the planet. This evidence suggests CO2 absorption leads to cooling of upper atmosphere, but not necessarily global cooling. But evidence indicates CO2 absorption reduces energy reaching upper atmosphere, making it cooler. That could be interpreted as CO2 causing cooling of upper atmosphere. But claim says limits won't cool the planet. That would be contradicted if evidence says CO2 causes cooling. But evidence is about upper atmosphere cooling, not global.

That means limiting CO2 will not cool the planet. Evidence: CO2 absorption cools upper atmosphere. So limiting CO2 would reduce that cooling, so it would not cool the planet.

That is, atmosphere absorbs less solar than IR. Evidence: list of statements. Let's parse.\n\nEvidence bullet points:\n\n- [Atmosphere of Earth] Solar radiation (or sunlight) is the energy Earth receives from the Sun. (just definition)\n- [Atmosphere of Earth] For example, O2 and O3 absorb almost all wavelengths shorter than 300 nanometers.

Evidence indicates that atmosphere absorbs some shortwave (UV) but also absorbs thermal (IR) via greenhouse effect. But does evidence say atmosphere less able to absorb shortwave? It says O2 and O3 absorb almost all wavelengths shorter than 300 nm. That is absorption of shortwave UV. But claim is about ability to absorb shortwave vs thermal. Evidence indicates that atmosphere does absorb shortwave (UV) and also absorbs thermal (IR). But does evidence say less ability to absorb shortwave? Not directly. It says O2 and O3 absorb almost all wavelengths shorter than 300 nm. That indicates high absorption of shortwave UV. So evidence suggests atmosphere is good at absorbing shortwave UV. But claim says less able to absorb shortwave than thermal. That would be contradicted by evidence that atmosphere absorbs shortwave strongly. But evidence also says greenhouse effect: atmosphere captures thermal energy. But we don't know relative amounts. Evidence does not quantify relative absorption. So evidence is neutral? Let's analyze.\n\nClaim: \"The atmosphere of the Earth is less able to absorb shortwave radiation from the Sun than thermal radiation coming from the surface.\" Means: absorption of shortwave < absorption of thermal. Evidence: O2 and O3 absorb almost all wavelengths shorter than 300 nm. That indicates high absorption of shortwave UV. That suggests atmosphere is able to absorb shortwave strongly. That contradicts claim that it's less able. But evidence also says greenhouse effect: atmosphere captures thermal energy. That indicates absorption of thermal. But we don't know relative amounts. But evidence indicates that atmosphere absorbs shortwave strongly (UV). So evidence contradicts claim. So label FAIL.\n\nConfidence? Evidence explicitly states that O2 and O3 absorb almost all wavelengths shorter than 300 nm. That is shortwave. So evidence says atmosphere absorbs shortwave strongly. Claim says less able to absorb shortwave than thermal. So evidence contradicts claim. So PASS? No, it's FAIL. Confidence high. 0.95.

This lists fluorinated gases as major greenhouse gases.

This indicates IPCC shows contributions but not specific numbers.\n\nClaim: \"Models and direct observations find that CFCs only contribute a fraction of the warming supplied by other greenhouse gases.\" That is, CFCs contribute only a fraction of warming relative to other greenhouse gases. Evidence: bullet 2 says CFCs have super greenhouse effect. bullet 3 says fluorinated gases are major greenhouse gases. bullet 5 says IPCC shows contributions but not numbers. None explicitly state that CFCs contribute only a fraction relative to others. Actually bullet 2 says super greenhouse effect, implying strong effect, maybe large contribution. bullet 3 says fluorinated gases are major greenhouse gases, implying significant contribution. So evidence does not support claim that CFCs only contribute a fraction; it might contradict or be neutral. The claim says CFCs only contribute a fraction of warming supplied by other greenhouse gases. That implies CFCs are smaller contributor. Evidence suggests CFCs are major greenhouse gases, maybe large contribution. So evidence contradicts claim? Let's see: bullet 3 says fluorinated gases are major anthropogenic greenhouse gases. That includes CFCs? Actually bullet 3 lists \"three groups of fluorinated gases (SF6, HFCs, PFCs)\" but not CFCs? Wait bullet 3: \"The seven sources of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion are (with percentage contributions for 2000\u20132004): Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide (N2O) and three groups of fluorinated gases (sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and perfluorocarbons (PFCs)) are the major anthropogenic greenhouse gases.\" That bullet seems to list CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, and three groups of fluorinated gases as major anthropogenic greenhouse gases. It doesn't mention CFCs. But bullet 2 mentions CFCs as part of fluorinated gases? It says \"CFCs and other unreactive fluorine-containing gases such as perfluorocarbons, HFCs, HCFCs, bromofluorocarbons, SF6, and NF3.\" So bullet 2 includes CFCs. So bullet 3 lists fluorinated gases but not CFCs? Actually bullet 3 lists SF6, HFCs, PFCs. CFCs are not listed. So bullet 3 does not mention CFCs. So evidence about CFCs is only bullet 2 and bullet 4. Bullet 2 says CFCs have super greenhouse effect. That implies strong effect, maybe large contribution. Bullet 4 says CFCs are greenhouse gases but regulated for ozone depletion. That doesn't say about warming contribution. So evidence does not support claim that CFCs only contribute a fraction. It might even suggest they are significant. So evidence contradicts claim? The claim says CFCs only contribute a fraction of warming supplied by other greenhouse gases. Evidence suggests CFCs are major greenhouse gases or have super greenhouse effect. So evidence contradicts claim. So label FAIL.\n\nConfidence: moderate.

This indicates aerosols can cool by scattering, but absorbing aerosols warm. Claim says fewer absorbing aerosols absorbing less sunlight leads to cooling effect. That matches: fewer absorbing aerosols means less absorption, so less warming? But claim says cooling effect on atmosphere due to fewer absorbing aerosols absorbing less sunlight. That seems consistent: fewer absorbing aerosols -> less absorption -> less warming -> cooling effect. So evidence supports that.\n\n- Global dimming: particles reflect and absorb sunlight, less sun rays reach Earth surface, cooler water and land surface temperatures, and also less cloud formation, dampening hurricanes. This says particles reflect and absorb sunlight, less sun rays reach surface, cooler surface. That contradicts claim's first part: claim says changes in cloud cover & aerosols lead to more sunlight hitting surface. But evidence says particles reflect and absorb sunlight, less sun rays reach surface. So evidence contradicts claim's first part. But claim also says compensated by cooling effect on atmosphere due to fewer clouds trapping less warmth and fewer absorbing aerosols absorbing less sunlight. Evidence about fewer clouds trapping less warmth? Global warming: If cloud cover increases, more sunlight reflected back, cooling planet. That suggests increased cloud cover leads to cooling. But claim says fewer clouds trapping less warmth? Wait: claim says \"cooling effect on the atmosphere due to fewer clouds trapping less warmth\". That means fewer clouds -> less trapping of warmth -> cooling effect? Actually fewer clouds would trap less warmth, meaning less greenhouse effect, so cooling. That matches evidence: If cloud cover increases, more sunlight reflected back, cooling planet. But that's about increased cloud cover leading to cooling. But claim says fewer clouds trapping less warmth leads to cooling. That is opposite: fewer clouds -> less trapping of warmth -> cooling. But evidence says increased cloud cover -> more sunlight reflected back, cooling planet. So evidence says increased cloud cover leads to cooling, not fewer. So evidence contradicts claim's statement about fewer clouds trapping less warmth leading to cooling. But maybe the claim is ambiguous: \"cooling effect on the atmosphere due to fewer clouds trapping less warmth\" could be interpreted as fewer clouds means less trapping of warmth, so less warming, so cooling. That matches evidence? Wait evidence says increased cloud cover leads to more sunlight reflected back, cooling planet. That is about increased cloud cover causing cooling. But claim says fewer clouds trapping less warmth leads to cooling. That is opposite: fewer clouds -> less trapping of warmth -> less warming -> cooling. But evidence says increased cloud cover -> more sunlight reflected back -> cooling. So evidence contradicts claim's statement about fewer clouds. But maybe the claim is about fewer clouds trapping less warmth, meaning less greenhouse effect, so cooling. That is consistent with evidence? Actually evidence says increased cloud cover leads to more sunlight reflected back, cooling planet. That is about increased cloud cover causing cooling. But claim says fewer clouds trapping less warmth leads to cooling. That is about fewer clouds causing cooling. So evidence contradicts claim's statement about fewer clouds. So evidence partially contradicts claim.\n\nAlso evidence about particulates: absorbing aerosols aloft heat surrounding air, inhibiting condensation, less cloud formation. That suggests absorbing aerosols cause less cloud formation. Claim says fewer absorbing aerosols absorbing less sunlight leads to cooling effect. But evidence says absorbing aerosols heat surrounding air, inhibiting condensation, less cloud formation. That is about absorbing aerosols causing less cloud formation. But claim says fewer absorbing aerosols leads to cooling effect. That is consistent: fewer absorbing aerosols -> less absorption -> less warming -> cooling. So evidence supports that part.\n\nBut overall evidence partially contradicts claim: global dimming says particles reflect and absorb sunlight, less sun rays reach surface, cooler surface. That contradicts claim's first part: changes in cloud cover & aerosols lead to more sunlight hitting surface. So evidence contradicts claim. So overall evidence contradicts claim.

Let's parse.\n\nEvidence bullet 1: \"Since the ocean off the Antarctic coast usually is much warmer than the air over it, the extent of the sea ice is largely controlled by the winds and currents that push it northwards.\" This says extent controlled by winds and currents, not directly about growth.\n\nBullet 2: \"The net change is a slight increase in the area of sea ice in the Antarctic seas (unlike the Arctic Ocean, which is showing a much stronger decrease in the area of sea ice).\" This says slight increase in area of sea ice in Antarctic seas. That supports claim that Antarctic sea ice has been growing.\n\nBullet 3: \"Increased sea ice extent does not indicate that the Southern Ocean is cooling, since the Southern Ocean is warming.\" This says increased extent does not mean cooling; Southern Ocean is warming. That supports claim that despite warming Southern Ocean, sea ice is growing.\n\nBullet 4: \"Sea ice coverage in the Arctic has shrunk at a much faster rate than it has expanded in the Southern Ocean.\" This indicates expansion in Southern Ocean, but not necessarily growth of sea ice? It says expanded in Southern Ocean. That supports claim.\n\nBullet 5: \"Sea ice extent expands annually in the Antarctic winter and most of this ice melts in the summer.\" This says expands annually in winter, melts in summer. That indicates growth in winter but not necessarily net growth. But claim says \"has been growing despite warming Southern Ocean.\" The evidence indicates slight increase net change, expansion in winter, but also melting in summer. But bullet 2 says net change slight increase. So evidence supports claim.\n\nThus evidence entails claim? Claim: \"The exception to this ice loss is Antarctic sea ice which has been growing despite the warming Southern Ocean.\" Evidence: net increase, increased extent, expansion in winter, etc. So evidence supports claim. So PASS.\n\nConfidence: high but maybe some nuance: bullet 5 indicates expansion in winter but melting in summer; net change slight increase. So evidence supports claim. So high confidence 0.90-0.99. But guidelines: \"Do not default to high confidence.\" But evidence is explicit: net increase, increased extent, expansion in winter, etc. So 0.95 maybe. But guidelines: \"Do not default to high confidence.\" But we can still give high confidence if evidence is explicit. So 0.95.\n\nLet's produce output.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>LABEL=PASS\nCONF=0.95\nRATIONALE="
