That seems contradictory? Wait: It says \"The ocean would not become acidic even if it were to absorb the CO2 produced from the combustion of all fossil fuel resources.\" That implies that even absorbing all CO2 from fossil fuels would not cause acidity? That contradicts earlier statements. But maybe it's a misinterpretation: maybe they mean \"The ocean would not become acidic even if it were to absorb the CO2 produced from the combustion of all fossil fuel resources\" meaning that the ocean would not become acidic if it absorbed all CO2? That seems contradictory. But maybe it's a mis-quote: maybe they mean \"The ocean would not become acidic even if it were to absorb the CO2 produced from the combustion of all fossil fuel resources\" meaning that the ocean would not become acidic even if it absorbed all CO2? That would contradict claim. But we need to interpret evidence as given. The bullet says: \"The ocean would not become acidic even if it were to absorb the CO2 produced from the combustion of all fossil fuel resources.\" That suggests that even absorbing all CO2 would not cause acidity. That contradicts claim that ocean is becoming more acidic as a result of absorbing CO2. But maybe the bullet is mis-structured: maybe they mean \"The ocean would not become acidic even if it were to absorb the CO2 produced from the combustion of all fossil fuel resources\" meaning that the ocean would not become acidic if it absorbed all CO2? That is contradictory. But we need to decide if evidence contradicts claim. But we have other bullets that support claim. So overall evidence is mixed: some support, some contradict. But we need to decide relationship: does evidence entail claim? Does evidence contradict claim? Or neutral? The claim: \"The ocean is absorbing massive amounts of CO2, and is becoming more acidic as a result.\" The evidence: first bullet: yes, acidification caused by uptake of CO2. Second bullet: yes, oceans becoming more acidic due to CO2 from fossil fuels. Third bullet: contradictory. Fourth bullet: \"It is expected to drop by a further 0.3 to 0.5 pH units ... by 2100 as the oceans absorb more anthropogenic CO2.\" That supports claim. Fifth bullet: \"Although the natural absorption of CO2 by the world's oceans helps mitigate the climatic effects of anthropogenic emissions of CO2, it is believed that the resulting decrease in pH will have negative consequences, primarily for oceanic calcifying organisms.\" That also supports claim.\n\nThus majority of evidence supports claim. The third bullet contradicts but maybe it's mis-structured. But we need to decide if evidence overall contradicts claim. The claim: \"The ocean is absorbing massive amounts of CO2, and is becoming more acidic as a result.\" The evidence: first bullet: yes. second bullet: yes. third bullet: contradictory. But maybe the third bullet is mis-structured: maybe they mean \"The ocean would not become acidic even if it were to absorb the CO2 produced from the combustion of all fossil fuel resources.\" That would mean that even absorbing all CO2 would not cause acidity. That contradicts claim. But we have other evidence that supports claim. So overall evidence is not fully contradictory. The claim is partially supported. The evidence does not fully entail claim because of contradictory bullet. But does it contradict? The contradictory bullet says ocean would not become acidic even if it absorbed all CO2. That contradicts claim that ocean is becoming more acidic as a result of absorbing CO2. But the claim is about current situation: \"The ocean is absorbing massive amounts of CO2, and is becoming more acidic as a result.\" The contradictory bullet says that even if it absorbed all CO2, it would not become acidic. That seems to contradict the claim that it is becoming more acidic as a result. But maybe the bullet is mis-structured: maybe they mean \"The ocean would not become acidic even if it were to absorb the CO2 produced from the combustion of all fossil fuel resources.\" That is contradictory. So evidence partially contradicts claim. But we need to decide if evidence contradicts claim. The evidence includes both supportive and contradictory statements. The claim is that ocean is becoming more acidic as a result of absorbing CO2. The evidence includes a statement that ocean would not become acidic even if it absorbed all CO2. That contradicts the claim. But the evidence also includes statements that ocean is becoming more acidic due to CO2. So evidence is mixed. According to guidelines, we need to choose PASS if evidence provides clear support for claim. But we have contradictory evidence. So we cannot say PASS. We need to decide if evidence contradicts claim. The contradictory bullet is strong: \"The ocean would not become acidic even if it were to absorb the CO2 produced from the combustion of all fossil fuel resources.\" That directly contradicts the claim that ocean is becoming more acidic as a result of absorbing CO2. So evidence contradicts claim. But we also have supportive evidence. But the contradictory evidence is strong enough to contradict claim. So we choose FAIL. But we need to consider guidelines: \"Choose FAIL only if the evidence provides clear support for the claim being false.\" The contradictory bullet does provide clear support for claim being false. So we choose FAIL. But we need to consider probability. The evidence is mixed. But the contradictory bullet is strong. So we can be fairly confident. But we need to calibrate confidence. The evidence is contradictory. So we can be fairly confident that evidence contradicts claim. So maybe 0.85. But guidelines: 0.75-0.89: evidence strongly suggests answer but requires minor inference.

This suggests public awareness influences belief. But not directly about CO2 smallness.\n\n- Bread: CO2 generation, on its own, is too small to account for the rise.

Let's parse.\n\n- \"These global climatic changes occurred slowly, prior to the rise of human civilization about 10 thousand years ago near the end of the last Major Ice Age when the climate became more stable.\" This says global climatic changes occurred slowly before 10k years ago, near end of last major ice age when climate became more stable. Not directly about warming or ice age.\n\n- \"The amount of heat trapping gases emitted into Earth's Oceans and atmosphere will prevent the next ice age, which otherwise would begin in around 50,000 years, and likely more glacial cycles.\" This says heat-trapping gases will prevent next ice age that would otherwise begin in ~50k years. So evidence says next ice age would be 50k years, not 10k. So claim says worry about global warming impacts in next 100 years, not an ice age in over 10,000 years. Evidence says next ice age would be 50k years, not 10k. So claim says not an ice age in over 10k years. Evidence says next ice age would be 50k years, which is over 10k. So evidence says there will be an ice age in 50k years, which is over 10k. That contradicts claim? Claim says not an ice age in over 10k years. Evidence says there will be an ice age in 50k years, which is over 10k. So evidence contradicts claim. But we must check: claim says \"not an ice age in over 10,000 years.\" That means there will not be an ice age in >10k years. Evidence says there will be an ice age in 50k years, which is >10k. So evidence contradicts claim. So label FAIL.\n\nBut we must consider if evidence is ambiguous: \"will prevent the next ice age, which otherwise would begin in around 50,000 years.\" That means if heat-trapping gases are emitted, they will prevent the next ice age that would otherwise begin in 50k years. So evidence says that due to greenhouse gases, the next ice age will be prevented. So there will not be an ice age in 50k years. So evidence says no ice age in 50k years. That aligns with claim: not an ice age in >10k years. So evidence supports claim. Wait, reading: \"The amount of heat trapping gases emitted into Earth's Oceans and atmosphere will prevent the next ice age, which otherwise would begin in around 50,000 years, and likely more glacial cycles.\" So due to greenhouse gases, next ice age prevented. So no ice age in 50k years. So claim says not an ice age in >10k years. That matches. So evidence supports claim. So PASS.\n\nBut we need to check other evidence: \"Global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 were equivalent to 49 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide.\" That indicates warming. \"Current projected consequences of global warming include a largely ice-free Arctic Ocean within 5\u201320 years.\" That indicates warming. \"Projections based on the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios suggest warming over the 21st century at a more rapid rate than that experienced for at least the last 10,000 years.\" That indicates warming.

But indicates that >2\u00b0C is possible.\n\nBullet 2: \"The current trajectory of global greenhouse gas emissions is not consistent with limiting global warming to below 1.5 or 2\u00b0C, relative to pre-industrial levels.\" This indicates that we are not on track to stay below 2\u00b0C. But not about consensus that we will pass point of no return if >2\u00b0C.\n\nBullet 3: \"Since the start of the 20th century, the global mean surface temperature of the Earth has increased by more than 0.7\u00b0C and the rate of warming has been largest in the last 30 years.\" Not relevant.\n\nBullet 4: \"On the basis of available data, climate scientists are now projecting an average global temperature rise over this century of 2.0 to 4.5\u00b0C.\" This indicates that scientists project 2-4.5\u00b0C. But claim: \"consensus among scientists and policy-makers is that we\u2019ll pass this point of no return if the global mean temperature rises by more than two degrees Celsius.\" The evidence says scientists project 2-4.5\u00b0C. But does it say consensus that we will pass point of no return if >2\u00b0C? Not explicitly. But we can infer that if >2\u00b0C, we might pass point of no return. But evidence bullet 5: \"The tipping point is difficult to predict, but is estimated to be between 3\u20134\u00b0C of global temperature rise.\" That indicates tipping point between 3-4\u00b0C. So >2\u00b0C is not necessarily tipping point. So evidence does not support claim that >2\u00b0C is point of no return. So claim is not entailed. Does evidence contradict claim?

But evidence does not say that photosynthesis is not involved. It says photosynthesis reduces CO2. That is consistent with claim that not photosynthesis activity? Wait, claim says not photosynthesis activity. That could mean photosynthesis is not the cause of CO2 increase. Evidence says photosynthesis reduces CO2, so it is not cause of increase.

Claim is more specific: Warmer seasons or triennial phases are followed by an atmosphere rich in CO2, reflecting gas solving or exsolving from water, and not photosynthesis activity. Evidence: photosynthesis reduces CO2, natural sources balanced by sinks, water dissolves CO2. Does evidence support that after warmer seasons, atmosphere rich in CO2 due to gas dissolving/exsolving from water? Not directly. Evidence does not mention warmer seasons or triennial phases. So evidence does not support that claim. It does not mention seasons. So evidence is neutral regarding that part. So overall evidence does not entail claim. Does evidence contradict claim? Claim says not photosynthesis activity. Evidence says photosynthesis reduces CO2, but not that it is not involved. But claim says not photosynthesis activity. That could be interpreted as photosynthesis activity is not responsible for CO2 increase. Evidence says photosynthesis reduces CO2, so it is not responsible for increase. So evidence supports claim that photosynthesis is not cause of CO2 increase. But claim also says atmosphere rich in CO2 due to gas solving/exsolving from water.

Let's parse each.\n\n- [Joe Barton] Texas Rep. Joe Barton supposedly once said that 'wind is a finite resource and harnessing it would slow the winds down, which would cause the temperature to go up.\n\nThis is a statement from Joe Barton. It says exactly the claim. So evidence includes the claim. But is it evidence? It's a statement by a person. The claim is that wind is finite and harnessing slows winds and causes temperature to go up. The evidence bullet says that Joe Barton supposedly said that. That is a direct statement of the claim. So evidence supports claim? It's a statement that the claim is true. But we need to determine if evidence entails claim. The evidence says \"Joe Barton supposedly once said that 'wind is a finite resource and harnessing it would slow the winds down, which would cause the temperature to go up.\" That is a claim that the claim is true. But does that entail the claim? Not necessarily; it's just a statement by a person. But the evidence is that Joe Barton said it. That doesn't prove the claim. But the evidence is a statement that the claim is true. But we need to see if evidence entails claim. The evidence is a statement that the claim is true. But that is not evidence that the claim is true; it's just a statement. So we cannot say it entails. But we might consider that the evidence is the claim itself. But the evidence is not a proof. So we cannot say PASS. We might say NA. But we need to check other bullet points.\n\n- [Wind] The westerlies can be particularly strong, especially in the southern hemisphere, where there is less land in the middle latitudes to cause the flow pattern to amplify, which slows the winds down.\n\nThis says westerlies can be strong, and less land causes flow pattern to amplify, which slows the winds down. Wait: \"which slows the winds down.\" That seems contradictory: westerlies strong but less land amplifies flow pattern, which slows the winds down. This is confusing. But it says \"which slows the winds down.\" So it says that westerlies can be strong, but less land amplifies flow pattern, which slows the winds down. So it says that something slows the winds down. But does it say harnessing wind slows winds? No. It says westerlies can be strong, but less land amplifies flow pattern, which slows the winds down. That is not about harnessing wind. So not relevant.\n\n- [Wind] As the temperature of the surface of the land rises, the land heats the air above it by conduction.\n\nThis is about temperature rising, land heating air. Not about wind harnessing.\n\n- [Wind] The furnaces were constructed on the path of the monsoon winds to exploit the wind power, to bring the temperatures inside up to 1,200\u00a0\u00b0C (2,190\u00a0\u00b0F).\n\nThis is about furnaces constructed on monsoon winds to exploit wind power, to bring temperatures inside up to 1200\u00b0C. Not about wind harnessing causing temperature to go up.\n\n- [Wind] The stream of particles varies in temperature and speed with the passage of time.\n\nThis is about stream of particles varying in temperature and speed. Not about wind harnessing.\n\nThus only the first bullet is relevant. It states the claim. But does it entail? It's a statement that someone said the claim. That is not evidence that the claim is true. So we cannot say PASS. It doesn't contradict either. So NA.\n\nThus label NA. Confidence maybe 0.7? Because evidence is ambiguous. The first bullet is a statement of the claim but not proof. So we can't say entail. So NA. Confidence maybe 0.7. Rationale empty.

Lysergic acid diethylamide: active dose of mescaline 0.2-0.5 g has effects comparable to 100 \u00b5g or less of LSD. Wait LSD is extremely potent; mescaline 0.2-0.5 g comparable to 100 \u00b5g LSD. So small amounts of very active substances cause large effects? Evidence shows that small amounts of caffeine (100 mg) cause sleep disruption; small amounts of LSD (100 \u00b5g) cause effects. But also alcohol requires high concentrations for effects. So evidence partially supports claim: small amounts of very active substances can cause large effects. But alcohol example contradicts? It says ethanol is low potency, effects only at high concentrations. That suggests small amounts do not cause large effects. But claim is general: small amounts of very active substances can cause large effects. The evidence includes substances with varying potency.

Not contradicting claim.\n\n- Global warming controversy: 2007 study concluded 22 most commonly used global climate models used by IPCC unable to accurately predict accelerated warming in troposphere though matched surface warming, concluding projections of future climate based on these models should be viewed with caution. This suggests models may be wrong, but not necessarily that dangerous global warming is not seen. It says models inaccurate for troposphere but matched surface warming.

Evidence doesn't say that.\n\n- Global warming: Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet prevent dangerous anthropogenic climate change. This seems to say that climate change prevents dangerous anthropogenic climate change? Wait: \"Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet prevent dangerous anthropogenic climate change.\" That sentence is weird. Might mean that climate change is prevented? Actually maybe it's a title: \"Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet\" is a book that says dangerous anthropogenic climate change. But the bullet says \"prevent dangerous anthropogenic climate change.\" That would support claim that dangerous global warming not seen? Not clear.\n\n- Greenhouse gas: IPCC pointed out many long-term climate scenario models require large-scale manmade negative emissions to avoid serious climate change. This indicates serious climate change is possible, not that it's not seen.\n\n- Sea level rise: This is an important confirmation of climate change simulations which predicted that sea level rise would accelerate in response to global warming.

Claim says \"we\u2019re not seeing dangerous global warming\" and \"climate models are wrong.\" Evidence partially supports models wrong but not the first part. So claim is partially contradicted.

This is about temperature trend.\n\n- [Global warming] IPCC AR4 WG1 Ch9 2007, p. 690: \"Recent estimates indicate a relatively small combined effect of natural forcings on the global mean temperature evolution of the second half of the 20th century, with a small net cooling from the combined effects of solar and volcanic forcings.\" This says combined natural forcings had small effect, net cooling from solar+volcanic. So combined natural forcings produce small net cooling. That suggests that when all forcings combined (natural) they show small net cooling, not good correlation to temperature? But the claim says \"When all forcings are combined, they show good correlation to global temperature throughout the 20th century including the mid-century cooling period.\" That implies that combined forcings (maybe including anthropogenic?) correlate well with temperature, including mid-century cooling. The evidence says natural forcings small effect, net cooling from solar+volcanic. That might support that combined natural forcings produce cooling that matches mid-century cooling? But the claim says \"good correlation to global temperature throughout the 20th century including the mid-century cooling period.\" The evidence says small combined effect of natural forcings on temperature evolution of second half of 20th century, with small net cooling from solar+volcanic. That might support that combined natural forcings produce cooling that matches mid-century cooling? But the claim says \"good correlation to global temperature throughout the 20th century including the mid-century cooling period.\" The evidence says small combined effect of natural forcings on temperature evolution of second half of 20th century. That might contradict the claim that combined forcings show good correlation to temperature throughout the 20th century. But the claim might refer to all forcings (natural + anthropogenic). The evidence only mentions natural forcings. So we cannot conclude about all forcings. The evidence says natural forcings small effect. That does not support or contradict the claim about all forcings. So evidence is neutral.\n\n- [Little Ice Age] The major differences between the various proxy reconstructions relate to the magnitude of past cool excursions, principally during the twelfth to fourteenth, seventeenth and nineteenth centuries. This is about past cool excursions, not 20th century.\n\n- [Little Ice Age] There is still a very poor understanding of the correlation between low sunspot activity and cooling temperatures. This is about correlation between sunspot activity and cooling, not 20th century.\n\n- [Solar activity and climate] Stott's group found that combining these factors enabled them to closely simulate global temperature changes throughout the 20th century. This says combining these factors (presumably solar, volcanic, etc.) enabled them to closely simulate global temperature changes throughout the 20th century. That supports the claim that combined forcings show good correlation to global temperature throughout the 20th century. But the claim also includes mid-century cooling period. The evidence says \"closely simulate global temperature changes throughout the 20th century.\" That likely includes mid-century cooling. So this evidence supports the claim.\n\nBut we need to see if the evidence contradicts the claim. The IPCC evidence says natural forcings small effect, net cooling from solar+volcanic. That might not contradict the claim that combined forcings show good correlation. It might support that combined natural forcings produce cooling that matches mid-century cooling. But the claim says \"When all forcings are combined, they show good correlation to global temperature throughout the 20th century including the mid-century cooling period.\" The evidence from Stott's group supports that. The IPCC evidence says natural forcings small effect, but that doesn't contradict the claim. So overall evidence is supportive.\n\nThus the evidence entails the claim? The claim: \"When all forcings are combined, they show good correlation to global temperature throughout the 20th century including the mid-century cooling period.\" The evidence: Stott's group found that combining these factors enabled them to closely simulate global temperature changes throughout the 20th century.

That supports claim that models failed to predict slowdown. Also mention that slowdown might be attributed to PDO. Also mention that IPCC definition of hiatus found no support for idea of hiatus. But claim says report acknowledges that most models failed to predict slowdown, resulting in less pronounced warming and more room in emissions budget. Evidence: first bullet: \"models did not generally reproduce observed reduction in surface warming trend over last 10-15 years\" - yes. That supports claim. Also second bullet: \"They used IPCC definition ... found no support for idea of hiatus\" - that contradicts claim? Wait claim says report acknowledges that most models failed to predict slowdown. That is consistent with first bullet. The second bullet says they found no support for hiatus, meaning they didn't find evidence of slowdown? But the claim is about models failing to predict slowdown, not about existence of slowdown. The second bullet says they found no support for hiatus, meaning they didn't find slowdown? That might contradict claim? Let's parse: The claim: \"report acknowledges that most models of warming trends failed to predict the slowdown in warming post-2000, resulting in less pronounced warming than predicted and thus more room in the CO2 emissions budget.\" So the report acknowledges that models failed to predict slowdown. That is about models failing to predict slowdown. The second bullet says \"They used the IPCC definition of the supposed hiatus as a slowdown in rate of temperature increase from 1998 to 2012, compared to the rate from 1951 to 2012, and again found no support for the idea of a 'hiatus' or slowdown.\" That indicates that the report found no support for the idea of a hiatus. That would mean the report did not find slowdown. But the claim says the report acknowledges models failed to predict slowdown. That could still be true even if they found no support for slowdown? Wait: If they found no support for slowdown, then there is no slowdown to predict. But the claim says models failed to predict slowdown. That could still be true if there was a slowdown but models didn't predict it. But if the report found no slowdown, then the claim that models failed to predict slowdown is irrelevant. But the claim says \"most models failed to predict the slowdown in warming post-2000, resulting in less pronounced warming than predicted and thus more room in the CO2 emissions budget.\" That implies that there was a slowdown, and models predicted more warming. But the evidence says they found no support for slowdown. So that contradicts the claim. But the first bullet says models did not reproduce observed reduction in warming trend. That indicates there was a slowdown. So evidence is contradictory: first bullet says slowdown observed, models didn't predict it. Second bullet says no support for slowdown. So evidence is inconsistent. But we need to decide relationship: does evidence entail, contradict, or neutral? The evidence includes both statements. The claim is that report acknowledges models failed to predict slowdown. The first bullet supports that. The second bullet contradicts that the report found no slowdown. But the claim is about models failing to predict slowdown, not about existence of slowdown. The second bullet says they found no support for slowdown, which would mean the report didn't find slowdown. But the claim says models failed to predict slowdown. If the report found no slowdown, then the claim that models failed to predict slowdown is irrelevant. But does that contradict? The claim says models failed to predict slowdown. If the report found no slowdown, then the claim is not necessarily contradicted; it's just that the report didn't find slowdown. But the claim says models failed to predict slowdown. That would be false if there was no slowdown. So the evidence that there was no slowdown contradicts the claim. But the evidence also says there was slowdown. So evidence is contradictory. We need to decide if evidence contradicts claim. The evidence includes contradictory statements. But we need to decide if evidence overall contradicts claim. The claim is that report acknowledges models failed to predict slowdown. The evidence includes a bullet that says \"Models do not generally reproduce the observed reduction in surface warming trend over the last 10\u201315 years\" which supports claim. Another bullet says \"They used the IPCC definition of the supposed hiatus as a slowdown in rate of temperature increase from 1998 to 2012, compared to the rate from 1951 to 2012, and again found no support for the idea of a 'hiatus' or slowdown.\" That contradicts claim. So evidence is contradictory. But we need to decide relationship: does evidence entail, contradict, or neutral? The evidence is contradictory, but does it contradict the claim? The claim is that report acknowledges models failed to predict slowdown. The evidence includes a statement that models did not reproduce slowdown, which supports claim. But also includes a statement that report found no support for slowdown, which contradicts claim. So evidence is not consistent. The claim might be partially supported but also contradicted. According to guidelines, we need to choose PASS if evidence provides clear support for claim. But evidence also contradicts claim. So we cannot say PASS. We need to decide if evidence contradicts claim. The evidence includes a direct contradiction: report found no support for slowdown. That contradicts claim that models failed to predict slowdown. So evidence contradicts claim. So label should be FAIL. But we need to consider if evidence is ambiguous. The evidence is contradictory. But the claim is about models failing to predict slowdown. The evidence includes a statement that models did not reproduce slowdown, which supports claim. But also a statement that report found no support for slowdown. Which one is more relevant? The claim is about models failing to predict slowdown. The evidence that models did not reproduce slowdown supports claim. The evidence that report found no support for slowdown contradicts claim. But the claim is about models failing to predict slowdown, not about existence of slowdown. If report found no slowdown, then models didn't fail to predict slowdown because there was no slowdown.

So claim says when accelerating ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica are factored, estimated sea level rise 2100 between 75cm to 2m. Evidence includes Greenland 0.3-3m, but not Antarctica.

Claim says \"estimated sea level rise by 2100 is between 75cm to 2 metres.\" Evidence provides ranges that include 75cm-2m but also ranges that are lower or higher.

Similarly, IPCC 60cm high end 2099, 90cm high end 2014. 60cm is below 75cm. So evidence does not entail claim. Does evidence contradict claim?

Evidence: bullet points mention various proxies, hockey stick, etc. Let's parse.\n\nEvidence bullet 1: \"A wide variety of temperature proxies together prove that the 20th century was the hottest recorded in the last 2,000 years.\" That says 20th century hottest in last 2000 years. That implies 1000 years ago (i.e., 1000 years before present, around 1000 AD) was not hottest; 20th century hotter. So evidence contradicts claim that world was same or warmer 1,000 years ago. But claim says \"same or warmer 1,000 years ago\" meaning world was same or warmer 1000 years ago compared to now? Wait claim: \"18 proxies tell us the world was the same or warmer 1,000 years ago.\" That implies that 1000 years ago, temperature was same or warmer than present. Evidence says 20th century hottest in last 2000 years, so 1000 years ago was cooler than 20th century, but could still be same or warmer than present? But evidence says 20th century hottest, so present is cooler than 20th century. But claim says 1000 years ago same or warmer than present. That could be possible if 1000 years ago was similar to present, but 20th century hotter. Evidence doesn't directly say 1000 years ago was same or warmer than present. It says 20th century hottest in last 2000 years. That doesn't preclude 1000 years ago being same or warmer than present. But evidence bullet 4: \"2013 used seafloor and lake bed sediment proxies to reconstruct global temperatures over the past 11,300 years, the last 1,000 years of which confirmed the original MBH99 hockey stick graph.\" The hockey stick graph shows 20th century warming, but last 1000 years had a relatively flat or slightly warming trend? The hockey stick shows a relatively flat baseline for last 1000 years, then sharp rise. So last 1000 years were similar to pre-20th century baseline, not warmer than present. So evidence suggests last 1000 years were not warmer than present. So evidence contradicts claim that world was same or warmer 1000 years ago? Wait claim says same or warmer. If last 1000 years were same as present, that would satisfy claim. But evidence says last 1000 years were similar to baseline, not warmer than present. But claim says same or warmer. So if last 1000 years were same as present, that would satisfy claim. But evidence says last 1000 years were similar to baseline, which could be same as present? But present is cooler than 20th century, but not necessarily cooler than baseline. The baseline might be similar to present. So evidence might support claim that last 1000 years were same as present. But evidence bullet 1 says 20th century hottest in last 2000 years, implying present is cooler than 20th century, but could be similar to baseline. So evidence does not contradict claim that last 1000 years were same as present. But bullet 4 says last 1000 years confirmed hockey stick graph, which shows relatively flat baseline, not warmer than present. That could be same as present. So evidence might support claim that last 1000 years were same as present. But claim says \"same or warmer\". So evidence supports \"same\" but not \"warmer\". So evidence does not contradict claim. But does it entail claim? Not necessarily, because claim says \"same or warmer\". Evidence says last 1000 years were same as present, which satisfies claim. So evidence supports claim. But we need to see if evidence explicitly states that last 1000 years were same or warmer. Bullet 4: \"last 1,000 years of which confirmed the original MBH99 hockey stick graph.\" The hockey stick graph shows last 1000 years relatively flat, not warmer. So evidence indicates last 1000 years were not warmer than present, but could be same. So evidence supports claim that last 1000 years were same or warmer. But does it explicitly say \"same or warmer\"? No. But we can infer that if last 1000 years were flat, they were similar to present. So evidence supports claim. But we need to decide PASS, FAIL, or NA. The claim: \"18 proxies tell us the world was the same or warmer 1,000 years ago.\" Evidence: bullet points mention 18 proxies? Not explicitly. But bullet 4 mentions 18 proxies? Actually bullet 4: \"2013 used seafloor and lake bed sediment proxies to reconstruct global temperatures over the past 11,300 years, the last 1,000 years of which confirmed the original MBH99 hockey stick graph.\" That might refer to 18 proxies? Not sure. But evidence bullet 1: \"A wide variety of temperature proxies together prove that the 20th century was the hottest recorded in the last 2,000 years.\" That implies many proxies. But claim says 18 proxies. Evidence does not mention 18 proxies. So evidence does not directly support claim. But we can infer that many proxies were used. But not explicit. So evidence is neutral?

This indicates that the first assessment schematic lacked temperature units, but the graph extended similar graph. It says \"appeared to depict higher temperatures during MWP than mid 20th century.\" That supports claim that schematic seemed to show MWP hotter than present. But does it say based on central England record? Not yet.\n\nBullet 2: \"The schematic was not an actual plot of data, and was based on a diagram of temperatures in central England, with temperatures increased on the basis of documentary evidence of Medieval vineyards in England.\" This says schematic based on diagram of temperatures in central England.

That suggests that the schematic ended in 1950s? Wait, claim says ended in 1950s. The evidence says Little Ice Age ended only in middle to late nineteenth century. That suggests that the schematic might have ended earlier? Actually the claim says ended in 1950s. The evidence says Little Ice Age ended only in middle to late nineteenth century. That might contradict the claim that schematic ended in 1950s? Let's analyze: The claim: \"ended in the 1950s.\" The evidence: \"Little Ice Age ended only in the middle to late nineteenth century.\" That indicates that the Little Ice Age ended earlier than 1950s. But the schematic might have ended in 1950s? The evidence says the Little Ice Age ended only in middle to late nineteenth century. That might contradict the claim that schematic ended in 1950s? Wait, the claim says the schematic ended in 1950s. The evidence says the Little Ice Age ended only in middle to late nineteenth century. That might be consistent: The schematic ended in 1950s, but the Little Ice Age ended earlier. But the claim is about the schematic ending in 1950s. The evidence says the Little Ice Age ended only in middle to late nineteenth century. That doesn't directly contradict the schematic ending in 1950s. But the claim says the schematic ended in 1950s. The evidence says the Little Ice Age ended only in middle to late nineteenth century. That might be consistent because the schematic might have ended in 1950s, but the Little Ice Age ended earlier. But the claim says the schematic ended in 1950s. The evidence says the Little Ice Age ended only in middle to late nineteenth century. That doesn't contradict the schematic ending in 1950s.

So evidence supports claim.\n\nThus evidence supports claim: The schematic was based on central England temperature record, and ended in 1950s? Wait, evidence about ending in 1950s? The claim says ended in 1950s. Evidence bullet 4 says Little Ice Age ended only in middle to late nineteenth century. That might be earlier than 1950s. But the claim says schematic ended in 1950s. The evidence doesn't explicitly say schematic ended in 1950s. But bullet 1 says \"appeared to depict larger global temperature variations over the past 1000 years, and higher temperatures during the Medieval Warm Period than the mid 20th century.\" That suggests the schematic extends to mid 20th century. But not necessarily ends in 1950s. But the claim says ended in 1950s. The evidence doesn't explicitly say ended in 1950s. So we cannot confirm that part.

Let's parse.\n\n- Cannabis cultivation: Adequate levels of CO2 must be maintained for the plants to grow efficiently. (This says adequate levels must be maintained; not necessarily pumping or 3x levels.)\n\n- Carbon dioxide: Plants can grow as much as 50 percent faster in concentrations of 1,000 ppm CO2 when compared with ambient conditions, though this assumes no change in climate and no limitation on other nutrients. (This indicates higher CO2 can increase growth; but not mention 3x or pumping.)\n\n- Greenhouse: Secondary metabolites, e.g., cardiac glycosides in Digitalis lanata, are produced in higher amounts by greenhouse cultivation at enhanced temperature and at enhanced carbon dioxide concentration. (This indicates greenhouse cultivation at enhanced CO2 leads to higher metabolites; but not mention 3x or pumping.)\n\n- Hydroponics: To increase yield further, some sealed greenhouses inject CO2 into their environment to help improve growth and plant fertility. (This says some sealed greenhouses inject CO2 to help growth; but not mention 3x or \"regularly\" or \"stronger, greener, healthier plants\".)\n\n- Vertical farming: Greenhouses commonly supplement carbon dioxide levels to 3\u20134 times the atmospheric rate. (This says greenhouses commonly supplement CO2 to 3-4 times atmospheric rate. That matches claim: \"Growers regularly pump CO2 into greenhouses, raising levels to three times that of the natural environment\". So evidence supports that part. Also claim says \"to produce stronger, greener, healthier plants.\" Evidence: \"Plants can grow as much as 50 percent faster in concentrations of 1,000 ppm CO2\" and \"secondary metabolites produced in higher amounts\" and \"inject CO2 to help improve growth and plant fertility.\" So evidence indicates higher CO2 leads to stronger, greener, healthier plants? Not explicitly \"stronger, greener, healthier\" but \"grow faster\" and \"higher metabolites\" and \"improve growth and plant fertility.\" That suggests improved plant health. So evidence supports claim.\n\nThus evidence entails claim? Let's check: Claim: \"Growers regularly pump CO2 into greenhouses, raising levels to three times that of the natural environment, to produce stronger, greener, healthier plants.\"\n\nEvidence: vertical farming bullet says \"Greenhouses commonly supplement carbon dioxide levels to 3\u20134 times the atmospheric rate.\" That covers \"growers regularly pump CO2 into greenhouses, raising levels to three times that of the natural environment.\" So yes. Also hydroponics bullet says \"some sealed greenhouses inject CO2 into their environment to help improve growth and plant fertility.\" That supports \"to produce stronger, greener, healthier plants.\" So evidence supports claim. So PASS.\n\nConfidence: evidence explicitly states 3-4 times atmospheric rate; claim says 3 times. So yes. Also evidence states \"to help improve growth and plant fertility\" which implies stronger, greener, healthier. So PASS. Confidence high: 0.95 maybe. But guidelines: 0.90-0.99: evidence explicit and unambiguous. Yes. So CONF=0.95.\n\nReturn lines.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>LABEL=PASS\nCONF=0.95\nRATIONALE="

Let's parse.\n\n- Cellulosic ethanol: \"The production of cellulosic ethanol represents not only a step toward true energy diversity for the country, but a very cost-effective alternative to fossil fuels.\" This suggests renewable alternative cost-effective. But claim says unlikely to exceed 15-20% until practical cost-competitive alternative.

But not directly.\n\n- Nuclear power debate: \"Obviously sun, wind, tides and waves cannot be controlled to provide directly either continuous base-load power, or peak-load power when it is needed,...\" \"In practical terms non-hydro renewables are therefore able to supply up to some 15\u201320% of the capacity of an electricity grid, though they cannot directly be applied as economic substitutes for most coal or nuclear power, however significant they become in particular areas with favourable conditions.\" This states that non-hydro renewables can supply up to 15-20% of capacity. That aligns with claim's threshold: unlikely to exceed 15-20% until alternative. This evidence supports claim that renewables limited to 15-20% currently. But claim says \"until we develop a practical, cost-competitive alternative to fossil fuels, it is unlikely that renewable energy will ever make up more than 15-20% of global energy requirements.\" The evidence says non-hydro renewables supply up to 15-20% of capacity of electricity grid. That is consistent with claim. But does it contradict? No. It supports.\n\n- Renewable energy: \"According to the International Energy Agency, biofuels have the potential to meet more than a quarter of world demand for transportation fuels by 2050.\" That suggests renewable could exceed 15-20% in transportation fuels by 2050. That might contradict claim? Claim says unlikely to exceed 15-20% of global energy requirements until alternative. But this evidence says biofuels could meet more than a quarter of world demand for transportation fuels by 2050. That is a subset of global energy requirements. But claim refers to global energy requirements overall. So this evidence does not necessarily contradict claim. It suggests potential for >25% of transportation fuels, but not necessarily overall energy. So not contradictory.\n\n- Renewable energy: \"National renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond, and some 120 countries have various policy targets for longer-term shares of renewable energy, including a 20% target of all electricity generated for the European Union by 2020.\" This indicates renewable energy share of electricity generation may reach 20% in EU by 2020. That is within 15-20% range. So consistent.\n\n- Renewable energy: \"Globally, the long-term technical potential of wind energy is believed to be five times total current global energy production, or 40 times current electricity demand, assuming all practical barriers needed were overcome.\" This suggests huge potential if barriers overcome. That could contradict claim? Claim says unlikely to exceed 15-20% until alternative. This evidence says potential could be huge if barriers overcome. But does it say barriers are not overcome? It says \"assuming all practical barriers needed were overcome.\" That is a hypothetical scenario. So not contradictory.\n\nThus overall evidence supports claim that renewables limited to 15-20% currently, but also indicates potential for >25% of transportation fuels by 2050 and huge potential if barriers overcome. But claim says \"unlikely that renewable energy will ever make up more than 15-20% of global energy requirements until we develop a practical, cost-competitive alternative to fossil fuels.\" The evidence does not directly contradict that; it suggests potential but not necessarily that it will exceed 15-20% before alternative. So evidence is neutral? It supports claim partially but not fully. The claim is about global energy requirements, not just electricity or transportation. Evidence about electricity grid capacity 15-20% and EU target 20% is consistent. Evidence about biofuels >25% of transportation fuels by 2050 is not contradictory. Evidence about wind potential huge if barriers overcome is not contradictory. So evidence does not contradict claim. Does it entail claim? Not fully. It supports but not fully.

Claim: record low sea ice is nothing new in Arctic, surprising for Antarctic. Evidence: bullet 1 says Antarctic sea ice increases then decreases at rates far exceeding Arctic. That indicates a decrease but at rates far exceeding Arctic. That could be surprising. But bullet 3 says extent of sea ice around Antarctica has remained roughly constant in recent decades, although thickness variation unclear. That suggests no change. That contradicts bullet 1? But bullet 3 says roughly constant extent. That might contradict bullet 1's decrease. But bullet 1 says decreases at rates far exceeding Arctic. That might be contradictory. But bullet 3 says roughly constant. So evidence is contradictory. But we need to see if evidence supports claim. Claim says surprising turn for Antarctic. Evidence bullet 1 indicates a decrease at rates far exceeding Arctic, which could be surprising. But bullet 3 says constant extent, which would not be surprising. So evidence is mixed. The claim is that record low sea ice is nothing new in Arctic, surprising for Antarctic. The evidence does not explicitly state record low sea ice in Antarctic. It says gradual increases then decreases at rates far exceeding Arctic. That could be surprising. But bullet 3 says constant extent. So evidence is contradictory. So we cannot conclude that claim is supported. The claim is not contradicted either? The evidence does not explicitly contradict the claim. It is ambiguous. So we choose NA.\n\nConfidence maybe 0.6?

That matches claim: 11 miles in six days. Also says less than 13 km (8 mi) of ice remains to prevent iceberg. That implies maybe 3 miles left? 13 km ~ 8 mi. If 11 mi already gone, 8 mi left?

The claim: \"Ocean acidification is the terrifying threat whereby all that man-made CO2 we\u2019ve been pumping into the atmosphere may react with the sea to form a sort of giant acid bath.\" The evidence includes statement that ocean would not become acidic even if absorb all CO2.

That might support the claim that alarmists are misrepresenting good news as bad? Wait claim: alarmists are taking good news about global warming improving plant health and making it seem like this good news is actually bad news because healthier plants mean more pollen. So claim is that alarmists are misrepresenting good news as bad. Evidence: \"changes are generally going to be good for us.\" That indicates that climate change is good, not bad.

Claim is about misrepresentation of good news. Evidence says negative impacts. That doesn't directly contradict misrepresentation claim.

That implies that alarmists are misrepresenting good news. Evidence says global warming will negatively impact environment, economy, communities. That suggests that global warming is negative, so good news is not good. That could support that alarmists are correct, not misrepresenting. So evidence contradicts claim?

So claim is inconsistent with evidence that natural sinks >14.5 Gt. But evidence says natural sinks >14.5 Gt, but claim says atmosphere rising 15 Gt. That would mean natural sinks <14.5 Gt.

This suggests that industrialization of livestock production was used to control avian influenza? Actually they used HPAI control to accelerate industrialization. So evidence suggests that industrial agriculture was used to control disease? But claim: preventing future pandemics requires more industrial agriculture. Evidence: Vietnam used industrialization to control HPAI. That supports claim? It suggests that industrialization was used as a strategy to control disease.

Claim: continued emissions at or above current rates would cause further warming and many changes in climate system during 21st century, likely larger than those observed during 20th century.\n\nEvidence: says continued emission will cause further warming and long-lasting changes, increasing likelihood of severe impacts. Also says climate model projections indicate temperature rise 0.3-1.7\u00b0C moderate scenario or 2.6-4.8\u00b0C extreme scenario depending on emissions. That indicates further warming. Also says many regions have seen increases in warm spells and heat waves, likely to continue. Also says greenhouse gases cause rise. So evidence supports claim that continued emissions cause further warming and changes. Does evidence say that changes will be larger than those observed during 20th century? Not explicitly. But IPCC says anthropogenic GHGs caused most increases since mid-20th century. But claim says likely larger than 20th century. Evidence does not explicitly state that 21st century changes will be larger. But climate model projections show potential temperature rise up to 4.8\u00b0C, which could be larger than 20th century warming (~0.6\u00b0C). But evidence does not explicitly compare. However, the claim says \"very likely be larger than those observed during the 20th century.\" Evidence: \"continued emission will cause further warming and long-lasting changes\" but not explicitly larger. But we can infer that if emissions continue at or above current rates, warming will continue and likely exceed 20th century warming. But evidence does not explicitly state that. But we might consider that the evidence includes IPCC AR4 concluding that anthropogenic GHGs caused most increases since mid-20th century. That implies that 20th century warming was largely due to GHGs. If emissions continue, further warming will occur. But does evidence say that it will be larger? Not explicitly. But the claim says \"very likely be larger than those observed during the 20th century.\" The evidence does not directly state that. So maybe it's not entailed. But we might consider that the evidence includes climate model projections of temperature rise up to 4.8\u00b0C, which is likely larger than 20th century warming (~0.6\u00b0C). But the evidence does not explicitly compare. But we can infer that if warming continues, it will be larger. But the evidence does not explicitly state that. So maybe we should choose NA? But guidelines: choose PASS only if evidence provides clear support for claim being true. The evidence does not explicitly state that changes will be larger than 20th century. So maybe NA.

Let's parse.\n\nEvidence bullet 1: \"Increased temperatures and altered hydrological cycles are predicted to translate to shorter growing seasons, overall reduced biomass production, and lower grain yields.\" This says longer growing seasons? Actually says shorter growing seasons. Contradicts claim? Claim says longer and warmer growing season has effect: plants take up more water, reducing stream flows. Evidence says increased temperatures lead to shorter growing seasons. That contradicts claim's premise of longer growing season. But claim is about effect of longer growing season. Evidence says longer growing season? Not directly. But evidence says shorter growing seasons. So evidence contradicts claim's premise. But does it contradict the effect? The claim: longer growing season leads to plants taking up more water, reducing stream flows. Evidence: shorter growing seasons, lower biomass, lower grain yields. That doesn't support or contradict the effect. But it contradicts the premise of longer growing season. So evidence contradicts claim? The claim includes premise that longer growing season occurs. Evidence says longer growing season not predicted. So evidence contradicts claim. So label FAIL.\n\nBut we must check other bullets: bullet 2: \"A reduction in runoff will affect the ability to irrigate crops and will reduce summer stream flows necessary to keep dams and reservoirs replenished.\" This supports effect of reduced stream flows due to reduced runoff. But claim says longer growing season leads to plants taking up more water, reducing stream flows. This bullet says reduction in runoff reduces stream flows. Not directly about longer growing season. But could be consistent with claim's effect. But not contradictory.\n\nBullet 3: \"While warmer temperatures create longer growing seasons, and faster growth rates for plants, it also increases the metabolic rate and number of breeding cycles of insect populations.\" This says warmer temperatures create longer growing seasons. That supports claim's premise. So evidence partially supports claim.\n\nBullet 4: \"As climate change more rapidly progresses, temperature increases will affect the length of the growing season.\" This is neutral.\n\nBullet 5: \"While summer growing seasons are expanding, winters are getting warmer and shorter, resulting in reduced winter ice cover on bodies of water, earlier ice-out, earlier melt water flows, and earlier spring lake level peaks.\" This says summer growing seasons expanding. Supports claim.\n\nThus evidence is mixed: some bullets support claim, some contradict. The claim: \"A longer and warmer growing season also has an effect, Dr. Overpeck said, as plants take up more water, further reducing stream flows.\" The evidence: bullet 1 contradicts longer growing season; bullet 3 supports longer growing season; bullet 5 supports longer growing season; bullet 2 supports effect of reduced stream flows; bullet 4 neutral.\n\nThus overall evidence is not clearly contradictory or supportive. The claim includes two parts: longer growing season and effect of plants taking up more water reducing stream flows. Evidence partially supports effect (bullet 2) and partially supports longer growing season (bullets 3 and 5). But bullet 1 contradicts longer growing season. So evidence is mixed.

Let's parse.\n\n- [Global warming] Currently, surface temperatures are rising by about 0.2 \u00b0C per decade. This indicates warming, not cooling. But claim about sun's cooling trend. Not directly about sun.\n\n- [Global warming] The period from 1983 to 2012 was likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 1400 years in the Northern Hemisphere, where such assessment is possible (medium confidence). This indicates warming, not cooling.\n\n- [Global warming] Globally, these effects are estimated to have led to a slight cooling, dominated by an increase in surface albedo. This says globally, effects led to slight cooling, dominated by increase in surface albedo. This is about global cooling, not sun.\n\n- [Quaternary glaciation] Based on orbital models, the cooling trend initiated about 6,000 years ago will continue for another 23,000 years. This is about orbital models, not sun.\n\n- [Solar activity and climate] In the three decades following 1978, the combination of solar and volcanic activity is estimated to have had a slight cooling influence. This says solar and volcanic activity had slight cooling influence. This could be interpreted as sun had slight cooling influence? It says combination of solar and volcanic activity had slight cooling influence. That implies solar activity contributed to cooling. But claim: \"the sun has shown a slight cooling trend.\" That is about sun's trend. The evidence says solar activity had slight cooling influence. That could support claim that sun had slight cooling influence. But claim says \"the sun has shown a slight cooling trend\" over last 35 years of global warming. The evidence says \"In the three decades following 1978, the combination of solar and volcanic activity is estimated to have had a slight cooling influence.\" That is about 1978-2008 roughly 30 years. That is about 30 years, not 35 years. But close. The evidence says solar activity had slight cooling influence. That could support claim. But the claim is about sun's trend, not necessarily solar activity. But the evidence says solar activity had slight cooling influence. That could be considered evidence that sun had slight cooling influence. So claim might be entailed? But we need to see if evidence explicitly states sun has shown slight cooling trend. It says combination of solar and volcanic activity had slight cooling influence. That implies solar activity contributed to cooling. But does it say sun has shown a slight cooling trend? Not exactly. It says solar activity had slight cooling influence. That could be interpreted as sun had slight cooling influence. But the claim is about sun's trend. The evidence is about solar activity's influence on climate. That might support claim. But is it explicit? The evidence says \"the combination of solar and volcanic activity is estimated to have had a slight cooling influence.\" That is not exactly \"sun has shown a slight cooling trend.\" But it implies solar activity contributed to cooling. So maybe the claim is partially supported. But we need to decide PASS, FAIL, or NA.\n\nWe need to see if evidence contradicts claim. Evidence includes warming trends, but not about sun. The evidence does not explicitly contradict claim. It does not say sun has warmed. So no contradiction. So not FAIL.\n\nDoes evidence entail claim? The evidence says solar activity had slight cooling influence. That could be considered evidence that sun had slight cooling influence. But the claim says \"In the last 35 years of global warming, the sun has shown a slight cooling trend.\" The evidence says \"In the three decades following 1978, the combination of solar and volcanic activity is estimated to have had a slight cooling influence.\" That is about 30 years, not 35. But close. The claim says last 35 years of global warming. The evidence says 30 years following 1978. That is roughly 1978-2008. The claim might refer to 35 years of global warming. But the evidence does not mention 35 years. So it's not a perfect match. But the evidence does support that solar activity had slight cooling influence. So maybe we can say evidence supports claim. But is it strong enough? The claim is about sun's trend. The evidence says solar activity had slight cooling influence. That is a bit different. But we can interpret that as sun had slight cooling influence. So maybe PASS.\n\nBut guidelines: \"Focus ONLY on what the evidence explicitly states or directly implies.\" The evidence says \"the combination of solar and volcanic activity is estimated to have had a slight cooling influence.\" That directly implies that solar activity contributed to cooling. So that supports claim that sun had slight cooling influence. So PASS.\n\nConfidence: moderate. 0.75. Rationale: evidence supports claim.

Claim: 11% of all global greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans are caused by deforestation. Equivalent to emissions from all cars and trucks.\n\nEvidence bullet 1: \"Tropical deforestation is responsible for approximately 20% of world greenhouse gas emissions.\" That is 20% of world GHG emissions. That is higher than 11%. So evidence suggests deforestation accounts for 20% of world GHG emissions. That would support claim? Claim says 11% of all global GHG emissions caused by humans are caused by deforestation. That is lower than 20%. So evidence contradicts? Wait: The bullet says tropical deforestation is responsible for approximately 20% of world GHG emissions. That is a specific figure. Claim says 11% of all global GHG emissions caused by humans are caused by deforestation. That is a different figure. The evidence says 20% of world GHG emissions. That is not necessarily contradictory because the claim might refer to all human-caused GHG emissions, not just tropical deforestation. But the bullet says tropical deforestation accounts for 20% of world GHG emissions. That is a subset of deforestation? Tropical deforestation is a subset of deforestation. So if tropical deforestation alone accounts for 20% of world GHG emissions, then total deforestation would be at least 20% (maybe more). So claim of 11% would be contradicted. So evidence contradicts claim.\n\nBut we need to consider the other bullet points: \"Of these emissions, 65% was carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning and industry, 11% was carbon dioxide from land use change, which is primarily due to deforestation, 16% was from methane, 6.2% was from nitrous oxide, and 2.0% was from fluorinated gases.\" This bullet says 11% of emissions were from land use change, primarily due to deforestation. That matches the claim: 11% of all global GHG emissions caused by humans are caused by deforestation. So evidence supports claim.\n\nBut we need to see if the bullet refers to \"these emissions\" meaning \"world greenhouse gas emissions\"? It says \"Of these emissions, 65% was carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning and industry, 11% was carbon dioxide from land use change, which is primarily due to deforestation, 16% was from methane, 6.2% was from nitrous oxide, and 2.0% was from fluorinated gases.\" This bullet likely refers to the same 100% of emissions. So 11% from land use change. That matches claim.\n\nBut the first bullet says tropical deforestation is responsible for approximately 20% of world greenhouse gas emissions. That is contradictory. But maybe the first bullet refers to tropical deforestation only, not all deforestation. So if tropical deforestation accounts for 20% of world GHG emissions, then total deforestation would be at least 20%. So claim of 11% would be false. But the second bullet says 11% from land use change. So which bullet is more reliable? The evidence is contradictory. The claim is that 11% of all global GHG emissions caused by humans are caused by deforestation. The evidence includes two bullet points that conflict: one says 20% of world GHG emissions from tropical deforestation; another says 11% from land use change. So the evidence is contradictory. But we need to decide if evidence supports or contradicts claim. The evidence is contradictory. But we need to choose PASS, FAIL, or NA. The guidelines: choose PASS if evidence provides clear support for claim. Choose FAIL if evidence provides clear support for claim being false. Choose NA if evidence is unrelated, insufficient, or does not bear on claim's truth value.\n\nHere evidence is contradictory. So we cannot say claim is definitely true or false. So we should choose NA. Because evidence is contradictory, we cannot determine. But we need to consider the claim: \"Eleven percent of all global greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans are caused by deforestation \u2014 comparable to the emissions from all of the cars and trucks on the planet.\" The evidence includes bullet 2: 11% from land use change. That supports claim. But bullet 1 says 20% from tropical deforestation. That contradicts. So evidence is ambiguous. So we choose NA.\n\nConfidence: moderate. 0.60-0.74. Let's choose 0.65.

That indicates that at least one of top five warmest years is 2009. Claim says five warmest years on record taking place since 2010. That would mean all five warmest years are after 2010. Evidence says 2009 could be among top five, so that contradicts claim. But evidence says 2009 could rank among top five warmest years. That suggests 2009 might be in top five. Claim says five warmest years since 2010. That would exclude 2009. So evidence contradicts claim.\n\nBut we need to see if evidence explicitly states 2009 is among top five. It says \"could rank among the top-five warmest years\". That is possibility, not certainty. So evidence does not definitively state 2009 is among top five. But it suggests possibility.

But it's not definitive. So evidence is neutral? Let's analyze.\n\nEvidence bullet 2: 2000s may have been warmest decade, with four of the five warmest years since 1850 having occurred in this decade. That means four of the five warmest years since 1850 occurred in 2000s decade (2000-2009). That includes 2009. So that suggests that at least four of the five warmest years are in 2000s decade. That would mean that at least four of the five warmest years are before 2010. That contradicts claim that all five warmest years are since 2010.

That would be about 0.53\u00b0C since 1975. That matches \"another half-degree in last quarter of century\" roughly. But bullet 1 says since 1975, not last quarter of century (which would be 1975-2000). But 1975-2000 is 25 years; 0.15-0.20\u00b0C per decade gives 0.375-0.5\u00b0C over 25 years. So bullet 1 supports warming of about half-degree in last quarter of century. Good.\n\nBut bullet 1 also says total warming 0.8\u00b0C since 1880. That implies 0.27\u00b0C warming before 1975 (1880-1975). That is less than half-degree. So bullet 1 does not support half-degree warming in first half of 20th century. It says 0.27\u00b0C warming before 1975. But the claim says half-degree from natural causes in first half of 20th century. That is not supported. Also bullet 3 says rise since mid-20th century due to greenhouse gases. That suggests warming after mid-20th century due to greenhouse gases, not natural causes.

This says CO2 lagged behind temperature at onset of glaciations, but not at beginning of deglaciations. The claim says lag 200-1000 years. This evidence partially supports but not fully. It says lag less than ~1000 years, but not necessarily 200-1000. Also says at beginning of deglaciations, CO2 increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years. So could be lag 0-1000.

Actually \"CO2 limits\" could refer to limits on CO2 concentration? The claim: \"CO2 limits won't cool the planet.\" Means that setting limits on CO2 will not cause cooling. So the claim is that limiting CO2 will not cool the planet. We need to see evidence: list of bullet points. Let's parse each bullet:\n\n- [Carbon dioxide] Less energy reaches the upper atmosphere, which is therefore cooler because of this absorption. This says CO2 absorbs energy, less energy reaches upper atmosphere, so upper atmosphere cooler. That suggests CO2 causes cooling of upper atmosphere? But claim is about cooling the planet. This bullet indicates that CO2 absorption leads to less energy reaching upper atmosphere, making it cooler. That could be interpreted as CO2 causing cooling of upper atmosphere. But does that mean limiting CO2 would not cool the planet? Actually if CO2 causes cooling of upper atmosphere, then limiting CO2 would reduce that cooling, maybe warming? But the bullet says less energy reaches upper atmosphere, which is cooler because of absorption. That indicates CO2 absorption leads to cooling of upper atmosphere. So if we limit CO2, less absorption, more energy reaches upper atmosphere, making it warmer. So limiting CO2 would not cool the planet; it would warm? So this bullet supports claim that CO2 limits won't cool the planet? Wait the bullet says CO2 absorption leads to cooling of upper atmosphere. So if we limit CO2, we reduce absorption, so less cooling, so upper atmosphere warmer. So limiting CO2 would not cool the planet. So bullet supports claim.\n\n- [Carbon dioxide] Occupational CO 2 exposure limits have been set in the United States at 0.5% (5000 ppm) for an eight-hour period. This is about occupational limits, not climate. Not relevant.\n\n- [Gaia hypothesis] As the temperature rises closer to the value the white daisies like, the white daisies outreproduce the black daisies, leading to a larger percentage of white surface, and more sunlight is reflected, reducing the heat input and eventually cooling the planet. This is about daisies, not CO2. Not relevant.\n\n- [Global warming] Global warming is the long-term rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system. Not relevant.\n\n- [Global warming] If cloud cover increases, more sunlight will be reflected back into space, cooling the planet. Not relevant.\n\nSo only first bullet is relevant. It says CO2 absorption leads to cooling of upper atmosphere. So limiting CO2 would reduce cooling, so not cool. So evidence supports claim. But we need to see if evidence explicitly states that limiting CO2 won't cool the planet. The bullet says less energy reaches upper atmosphere, which is cooler because of absorption. That implies CO2 causes cooling. So limiting CO2 would reduce cooling. So evidence supports claim that CO2 limits won't cool the planet. So PASS.\n\nConfidence: moderate. The bullet is somewhat ambiguous but indicates CO2 absorption leads to cooling of upper atmosphere. So claim that limiting CO2 won't cool the planet is supported. So high confidence maybe 0.85. But guidelines: we need to calibrate. The evidence is explicit: \"Less energy reaches the upper atmosphere, which is therefore cooler because of this absorption.\" That indicates CO2 absorption leads to cooling.

So forests' humidity contributed to moisture-laden winds; without it, winds dry.\n\nEvidence: various statements about forests, humidity, winds.\n\nWe need to see if evidence supports claim (entail) or contradicts or neutral.\n\nLet's parse evidence:\n\n1. Aralam Wildlife Sanctuary: \"Strong winds of dry nature blow from September to April, causing dryness in the locality with the result there is a fire hazard, especially in the deciduous forests.\" This says strong dry winds blow; dryness due to winds. Not about forests' humidity causing moisture-laden winds. It says dry winds cause dryness. This could contradict claim? Claim says without forests' humidity, winds dry. This evidence says dry winds blow regardless of forests' humidity? It says strong dry winds blow from Sep to Apr. It doesn't mention forests' humidity. So evidence doesn't support claim; maybe neutral.\n\n2. Cloud forest: \"An important feature of cloud forests is the tree crowns can intercept the wind-driven cloud moisture, part of which drips to the ground.\" This indicates that cloud forests intercept moisture from wind, causing moisture-laden winds? Actually wind-driven cloud moisture is intercepted by tree crowns. So forests intercept moisture from wind, not produce it. This suggests that forests reduce moisture in wind? Wait: wind-driven cloud moisture is intercepted by tree crowns, part drips to ground. So the wind has moisture; forests intercept it. So forests' humidity? The claim: Without forests' humidity, previously moisture-laden winds blew dry. This evidence suggests that forests intercept moisture from wind, but doesn't say that forests' humidity causes winds to be moisture-laden. It says wind-driven cloud moisture is intercepted by tree crowns. So maybe forests reduce moisture in wind? Not support claim.\n\n3. Dwarf forest: \"Throughout the year, wind speed, temperature and humidity are fairly consistent, with humidity usually greater than 90%.\" This indicates high humidity in dwarf forest. But doesn't say about winds being moisture-laden or dry. Could support claim that forests have high humidity. But claim: Without forests' humidity, winds dry. This evidence indicates forests have high humidity, but not about effect on winds. So neutral.\n\n4. Neotropical realm: \"Laurel forest and other cloud forest are subtropical and mild temperate forest, found in areas with high humidity and relatively stable and mild temperatures.\" Again indicates forests high humidity. Not about winds.\n\n5. Sierra Madre Occidental: \"This causes east winds bringing moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.\" This indicates east winds bring moisture from Gulf. Not about forests.\n\nThus evidence does not explicitly support claim that without forests' humidity, winds dry. It doesn't contradict either. So neutral.\n\nThus label NA.\n\nConfidence moderate: 0.60-0.74? The evidence is relevant but conclusion requires interpretation.

Let's parse.\n\nEvidence bullet 1: 20th century average global temperature increased by about 0.8\u00b0C since 1880; two-thirds since 1975. That indicates warming after 1880, but not necessarily during Industrial Revolution (which started mid-18th century). This evidence suggests warming after 1880, but does not directly address Industrial Revolution period (roughly 1750-1900). So evidence does not contradict claim; it doesn't support claim either. It's neutral.\n\nBullet 2: \"Climate proxy records show that natural variations offset the early effects of the Industrial Revolution, so there was little net warming between the 18th century and the mid-19th century, when thermometer records began to provide global coverage.\" This says little net warming between 18th century and mid-19th century. That includes Industrial Revolution period. So evidence suggests no net warming during that period. That supports claim that we didn't have global warming during Industrial Revolution. So evidence supports claim.\n\nBullet 3: \"Before the Industrial Revolution, naturally occurring amounts of greenhouse gases caused the air near the surface to be warmer by about 33\u00b0C than it would be in their absence.\" This is about natural greenhouse effect, not about warming during Industrial Revolution. Not relevant to claim.\n\nBullet 4: \"Human activity since the Industrial Revolution has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to increased radiative forcing from CO2, methane, tropospheric ozone, CFCs, and nitrous oxide.\" This says human activity since Industrial Revolution increased greenhouse gases. That implies warming after Industrial Revolution, but not necessarily during. But it indicates that warming started after Industrial Revolution. It doesn't contradict claim that there was no warming during the Industrial Revolution. It might support claim that warming started after.\n\nBullet 5: \"Human activities resulting from the industrial revolution have changed the chemical composition of the atmosphere....Deforestation is now the second largest contributor to global warming, after the burning of fossil fuels.\" This indicates that industrial revolution changed composition, but not necessarily that warming occurred during that period.

Let's parse each bullet:\n\n1. \"When climate sensitivity is expressed for a doubling of CO2, its units are degrees Celsius (\u00b0C).\" This is general fact about units. Not about range.\n\n2. \"In his first paper on the matter, he estimated that global temperature would rise by around 5 to 6 \u00b0C (9.0 to 10.8 \u00b0F) if the quantity of CO2 was doubled.\" This is a different estimate (5-6\u00b0C). Not same as claim.\n\n3. \"For constant humidity they computed a climate sensitivity of 2.3 \u00b0C per doubling of CO2 (which they rounded to 2, the value most often quoted from their work, in the abstract of the paper).\" This says 2.3\u00b0C per doubling. That matches median value 2.3\u00b0C. But claim says likely 1.7-2.6\u00b0C with median 2.3\u00b0C. This bullet gives a single value 2.3\u00b0C, not a range. But could be consistent with claim? The claim says likely 1.7-2.6\u00b0C. The bullet says 2.3\u00b0C. That is within that range. But does it provide probability? No. So evidence partially supports but not fully.\n\n4. \"The equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is the temperature increase that would result from sustained doubling of the concentration of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere, after the Earth's energy budget and the climate system reach radiative equilibrium.\" This is definition.\n\n5. \"IPCC authors concluded ECS is very likely to be greater than 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F) and likely to lie in the range 2 to 4.5 \u00b0C (4 to 8.1 \u00b0F), with a most likely value of about 3 \u00b0C (5 \u00b0F).\" This says likely range 2-4.5\u00b0C, most likely 3\u00b0C. This is different from claim's range 1.7-2.6\u00b0C. So evidence contradicts claim? The claim says likely 1.7-2.6\u00b0C. Evidence says likely 2-4.5\u00b0C. Overlap 2-2.6\u00b0C. But evidence says likely greater than 1.5\u00b0C and likely to lie in range 2-4.5\u00b0C. That is not contradictory but different. The claim's range 1.7-2.6\u00b0C is narrower and lower. The evidence says likely 2-4.5\u00b0C. That includes 2-2.6\u00b0C but also extends higher. So evidence does not contradict claim but does not fully support it. The claim says likely 1.7-2.6\u00b0C. Evidence says likely 2-4.5\u00b0C. So claim's lower bound 1.7\u00b0C is lower than evidence's lower bound 2\u00b0C. So evidence suggests lower bound should be 2\u00b0C. So claim's lower bound 1.7\u00b0C is too low. So evidence contradicts claim? The claim says likely 1.7-2.6\u00b0C. Evidence says likely 2-4.5\u00b0C. So claim's range is not fully supported. But does evidence contradict? It says likely 2-4.5\u00b0C. That includes 1.7-2.6\u00b0C partially. But the claim says likely 1.7-2.6\u00b0C. The evidence says likely 2-4.5\u00b0C. So the claim's range is narrower and lower. The evidence does not explicitly say that 1.7-2.6\u00b0C is not likely. It just says likely 2-4.5\u00b0C. That could still be consistent if the probability distribution is such that 1.7-2.6\u00b0C is within the likely range? But \"likely\" is ambiguous. The evidence says \"likely to lie in the range 2 to 4.5\u00b0C\". That implies the likely range is 2-4.5\u00b0C. So 1.7-2.6\u00b0C is not the likely range. So claim is not supported. So evidence contradicts claim? The claim says likely 1.7-2.6\u00b0C. Evidence says likely 2-4.5\u00b0C. So claim's lower bound is too low. So evidence contradicts claim. So label FAIL.\n\nBut we must consider the bullet 3: \"For constant humidity they computed a climate sensitivity of 2.3\u00b0C per doubling of CO2 (which they rounded to 2, the value most often quoted from their work, in the abstract of the paper).\" That bullet is from the same paper? It says \"the abstract of the paper\". That might be the Science paper. It says they computed 2.3\u00b0C. That matches median 2.3\u00b0C. But the claim says likely 1.7-2.6\u00b0C with median 2.3\u00b0C. The bullet says 2.3\u00b0C. That is consistent with median. But does it provide probability? No. So evidence partially supports but not fully. But bullet 5 contradicts claim's range. So overall evidence contradicts claim. So label FAIL.\n\nConfidence: moderate. Because evidence 5 contradicts claim. So maybe 0.75. Rationale: evidence 5 says likely 2-4.5\u00b0C, not 1.7-2.6\u00b0C. So claim is not supported. So FAIL.

So claim: Mitch Taylor said we are seeing an increase in bears that is unprecedented, and in places where we are seeing a decrease in the population. So basically he said there is an increase in some places, but decrease in others. The evidence: bullet points about caribou, polar bear populations, etc. Let's parse evidence:\n\n- Baffin Island: caribou population decreased 95% from 1990s. Not about polar bears.\n\n- \"Ask the experts: Are polar bear populations increasing?\" Not a statement.\n\n- \"In two areas where harvest levels have been increased based on increased sightings, science-based studies have indicated declining populations, and a third area is considered data-deficient.\" This says: In two areas where harvest increased based on increased sightings, studies show declining populations. So there are areas where increased sightings led to increased harvest, but populations are declining. That suggests that increased sightings may not reflect increased population. But the claim says \"increase in bears that\u2019s unprecedented, and in places where we\u2019re seeing a decrease in the population.\" That matches: there are places where we see increase in bears but population decreasing. The evidence says: In two areas where harvest increased based on increased sightings, studies show declining populations. That is consistent with claim: increase in sightings but decrease in population. So evidence supports claim? The claim says \"increase in bears that\u2019s unprecedented, and in places where we\u2019re seeing a decrease in the population.\" The evidence says \"In two areas where harvest levels increased based on increased sightings, science-based studies have indicated declining populations.\" That is similar: increased sightings but declining populations. So evidence supports claim. But does evidence mention \"unprecedented\"? Not. But claim includes \"unprecedented\". Evidence doesn't mention unprecedented. But the claim is partially supported: evidence indicates that increased sightings but declining populations. So evidence supports part of claim. But does it entail the claim? The claim is that Mitch Taylor said we are seeing an increase in bears that\u2019s unprecedented, and in places where we\u2019re seeing a decrease in the population. The evidence says there are areas where increased sightings but declining populations. That matches the second part. But the first part \"increase in bears that\u2019s unprecedented\" is not directly supported. But the evidence does not contradict it. So evidence is neutral? It supports part but not entire claim. The guidelines: choose PASS only if evidence provides clear support for claim being true. Evidence does not fully support claim. It partially supports. So maybe NA.

Let's parse.\n\nEvidence bullet points:\n\n1. \"Climate change feedback is important in the understanding of global warming because feedback processes may amplify or diminish the effect of each climate forcing, and so play an important part in determining the climate sensitivity and future climate state.\" This says feedback processes may amplify or diminish effect; they play part in determining climate sensitivity. Not specific about negative feedback or low sensitivity.\n\n2. \"Observations and modelling studies indicate that there is a net positive feedback to warming.\" This says net positive feedback. That contradicts claim that negative feedback processes associated with low sensitivity. But claim says \"observed behavior of radiation fluxes implies negative feedback processes associated with relatively low climate sensitivity.\" Observed behavior of radiation fluxes? The evidence says net positive feedback. That contradicts negative feedback. So evidence contradicts claim.\n\n3. \"The main negative feedback comes from the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law, the amount of heat radiated from the Earth into space changes with the fourth power of the temperature of Earth's surface and atmosphere.\" This states main negative feedback from Stefan-Boltzmann law. That supports negative feedback. But claim says negative feedback processes associated with relatively low climate sensitivity. This evidence says main negative feedback from Stefan-Boltzmann law. That could support negative feedback. But does it imply low climate sensitivity? Not necessarily. The claim is about observed behavior of radiation fluxes implying negative feedback processes associated with relatively low climate sensitivity. The evidence about Stefan-Boltzmann law is a negative feedback but not necessarily low sensitivity. So partial support but not full.\n\n4. \"Models not only project different future temperature with different emissions of greenhouse gases, but also do not fully agree on the strength of different feedbacks on climate sensitivity and the amount of inertia of the system.\" This indicates uncertainty about feedback strength and climate sensitivity. Not directly supporting claim.\n\n5. \"Negative reinforcement occurs when the rate of a behavior increases because an aversive event or stimulus is removed or prevented from happening.\" This is about reinforcement, not climate.\n\nThus evidence is mixed: one bullet says net positive feedback, which contradicts claim. Another bullet says main negative feedback from Stefan-Boltzmann law, which supports negative feedback but not low sensitivity. The claim: \"observed behavior of radiation fluxes implies negative feedback processes associated with relatively low climate sensitivity.\" The evidence about net positive feedback contradicts negative feedback.

Does evidence support claim that satellite and surface measurements observe an enhanced greenhouse effect at wavelengths that CO2 absorb energy? The evidence states CO2 absorbs and emits at those wavelengths, and that this absorption traps energy near surface, warming surface and lower atmosphere. It doesn't explicitly mention satellite and surface measurements observing enhanced greenhouse effect. But it does mention that absorption of infrared light at vibrational frequencies traps energy near surface, warming surface and lower atmosphere. That implies that measurements would observe enhanced greenhouse effect. But evidence doesn't mention satellite or surface measurements. The claim: \"satellite and surface measurements observe an enhanced greenhouse effect at the wavelengths that CO2 absorb energy.\" The evidence: \"CO2 absorbs and emits infrared radiation at wavelengths ... and consequently is a greenhouse gas that plays a significant role in influencing Earth's surface temperature through the greenhouse effect.\" Also \"Absorption of infrared light at the vibrational frequencies of atmospheric carbon dioxide traps energy near the surface, warming the surface and the lower atmosphere.\" That indicates that the greenhouse effect is observed.

But the claim is that satellite and surface measurements observe an enhanced greenhouse effect at wavelengths that CO2 absorb energy. The evidence says CO2 absorbs and emits at those wavelengths and that this absorption traps energy near surface, warming surface and lower atmosphere. That implies that measurements would observe enhanced greenhouse effect. But the evidence doesn't mention satellite or surface measurements. So is it entailed? The claim is about observations. The evidence states that CO2 absorption leads to warming. That is consistent with observations. But does it entail that satellite and surface measurements observe it? It might be considered that the evidence supports the claim that CO2 absorption leads to greenhouse effect, but not necessarily that satellite and surface measurements observe it. However, the claim is that satellite and surface measurements observe an enhanced greenhouse effect at wavelengths that CO2 absorb energy. The evidence states that CO2 absorbs and emits at those wavelengths and that this absorption traps energy near surface, warming surface and lower atmosphere. That is consistent with the claim. But does it entail? The evidence does not mention satellite or surface measurements. But the claim is about observations. The evidence states that CO2 absorption leads to warming. That is a general statement, not specifically about satellite or surface measurements. But the claim is that satellite and surface measurements observe an enhanced greenhouse effect at wavelengths that CO2 absorb energy. The evidence does not mention satellite or surface measurements. So it's not explicitly entailed. It might be considered neutral. But we need to decide.\n\nGiven guidelines: \"Focus ONLY on what the evidence explicitly states or directly implies.\" The evidence states CO2 absorbs and emits at wavelengths 4.26 \u00b5m and 14.99 \u00b5m, and that this absorption traps energy near surface, warming surface and lower atmosphere. This implies that the greenhouse effect is observed at those wavelengths. But the claim specifically says \"satellite and surface measurements observe an enhanced greenhouse effect at the wavelengths that CO2 absorb energy.\" The evidence does not mention satellite or surface measurements. But it does mention that absorption traps energy near surface, warming surface and lower atmosphere. That is essentially the greenhouse effect. So the evidence supports the claim that there is an enhanced greenhouse effect at those wavelengths. But does it mention satellite and surface measurements? No. But the claim is that satellite and surface measurements observe it. The evidence does not mention that. So it's not entailed.

It mentions growth for some islands. No mention of loss. So evidence does not support claim. Does it contradict? It doesn't explicitly say that 14% lost area; it says some islands grew. That doesn't contradict 14% lost area? If 14% lost area, some islands lost area. But evidence shows growth for some islands; doesn't say others lost. So evidence is neutral?
